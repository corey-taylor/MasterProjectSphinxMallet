Quality Audit BQA to examine the patterns of completion axillary lymph node dissection cALND after sentinel lymph node SLN biopsy in women treated for early breast cancer in Australia and New Zealand and to compare it to the Australian and New Zealand guidelines in cases of both positive and negative SLN results Materials and methods Patients were sub grouped as having primary tumours 3 cm and 3 cm and further analysed according to year of surgery SLN status and ﬁnal nodal status where cALND was recorded Multivariate analysis was performed examining tumour size grade presence of lymphovascular invasion LVI HER2 and oestrogen receptor status patient age and number of positive sentinel nodes as predictors for subsequent axillary surgery Results 14879 patients were identiﬁed from 2006 to 2010 79 8 of patients with a positive SLN result underwent cALND Age 70 years and a greater number of involved SLN predicted no cALND among SLN positive patients 10 3 of patients who had a negative SLN result underwent cALND Younger age higher grade lymphovascular invasion and tumour size 3 cm predicted cALND among SLN negative patients Conclusions According to the BQA from 2006 to 2010 the Australian and New Zealand guideline recommendations for SLN positive patients to have cALND and SLN negative patients not to have cALND were adhered to in 79 8 and 89 7 of cases respectively

less centimetres in diameter with either impalpable or palpable but not ﬁxed lymph nodes and no evidence of distant metastases 1 Sentinel lymph node SLN biopsy is commonly used to stage the axilla in women with early breast cancer by allowing identiﬁcation for pathological examination of the nodes at highest risk of harbouring metastases Corresponding author Department of Surgery Royal Perth Hospital Perth Western Australia 6000 Australia Tel þ61 401570879 E mail address chiltonchong hotmail com C Chong SLN biopsy has been shown to provide highly sensitive and speciﬁc staging information with lower morbidity than axillary lymph node dissection in women with unifocal breast cancer 3 cm 2 As a result of overwhelming single and multiple institution data and randomised trials 3e5 in 2008 Australia s National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre now Cancer Australia recommended SLN biopsy as a valid alternative to ALND for cases of unifocal early breast cancer 3 cm 6 The guidelines recommended a completion axillary lymph node dissection cALND when a sentinel node is found to have a metastatic deposit and also recommended that if the SLN is negative then the axilla should be observed only New Zealand s current National Guidelines on the Management of Early Breast Cancer published in 2009 have made the same recommendations 7 0960 9776 e see front matter Ó 2013 Elsevier Ltd

Quality Audit BQA to examine the patterns of cALND performed on women in Australia and New Zealand and compare them to the Australian and New Zealand clinical guidelines on axillary node management in cases of both positive and negative SLN results Methods The BQA is a contemporary clinical database developed in 1998 as a joint initiative of the Breast Section of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons RACS in conjunction with the Australian Safety and Efﬁcacy Register of New Interventional Procedures e Surgical ASERNIP S operating out of the Research Audit and Academic Surgery Division of the RACS Contribution to the audit was initially voluntary although participation is now mandatory for member surgeons of the Breast Surgeon s Society of Australia and New Zealand BreastSurgANZ The BQA is the largest database recording breast cancer surgery in Australia and New Zealand and today contains over 120 000 episodes of breast cancer with more than 330 surgeons contributing data each year from both countries The data set includes variables relating to demography method of diagnosis surgeries performed pathology data and adjuvant therapies Between January 1999 and May 2011 70 688 episodes of early breast cancer with axillary surgery data were reported to the BQA Data entered prior to 2006 were less complete and therefore excluded from study as were episodes with missing data and patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy The data recorded in the BQA for locoregional recurrence and survival events is incomplete and unreliable and therefore those endpoints were not available for analysis The BQA deﬁnes tumour size as the measurement of the invasive component of tumour in the pathology report for multiple tumours only the maximum diameter of the largest primary lesion is recorded Patients were sub grouped as having primary tumours 3 cm and 3 cm since amongst the randomised trial populations validating SLN biopsy tumours 3 cm in diameter were not well represented 2 4 5 Patients were subsequently analysed according to year of surgery SLN status and ﬁnal nodal status where a second axillary surgery was recorded The data includes both those subsequent axillary surgeries performed on the same day for example after frozen section or on a separate day of surgery A positive sentinel node result is deﬁned by the BQA as one in which the affected node s has a tumour deposit 0 2 mm in size Conversely cases of isolated tumour cells in sentinel nodes tumour deposits 0 2 mm are categorised by the BQA as being node negative Unfortunately at that time the BQA did not categorise size of SLN metastases so data on isolated tumour cells versus micrometastases versus macrometastases were not available Multivariate analyses were performed on prognostic factors that may predict locoregional failure including pathologic tumour size modiﬁed BloomeRichardson grade lymphovascular invasion LVI oestrogen receptor ER and HER2 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor

of patients with tumours 3 cm had at least one positive SLN Despite the guideline recommendation of cALND for these women only 78 7 of these SLN positive patients were recorded as having undergone subsequent axillary surgery leaving 21 3 with no documented second surgery This pattern of subsequent axillary surgery remained constant over the ﬁve year study period Of the remaining 75 9 of patients with tumours 3 cm and a negative SLN 9 6 963 proceeded to second surgery in spite of the guideline recommendations to only observe the axilla The proportion of SLN negative patients proceeding to second axillary surgery fell from 14 1 in 2006 to 6 9 by 2010 Among this cohort of SLN negative patients undergoing second axillary surgery 176 18 3 were subsequently found to then have node positive disease Fig 1 Results of second axillary surgery for tumours 3 cm Please cite this article in press as Chong C et al Subsequent axillary surgery after sentinel lymph node biopsy Results

patients did not record a subsequent axillary surgery regardless of tumour size This rate of failure to proceed to cALND was consistent over the observation period and echoes a recent paper by Morris et al 8 who found that in the ﬁrst six months following the 2008 release of the NBOCC guidelines on the use of SLN biopsy only 77 of women with positive SLN in the BQA went on to receive ALND Variance from guidelines for SLN positive patients arguably represents under treatment of the axilla Multivariate analysis showed that patient age 70 years was a signiﬁcant predictor for SLN positive patients foregoing cALND when compared to younger aged cohorts Table 1 Indeed elderly patients with breast cancer are commonly noted in the literature to undergo differing management pathways from younger women with equivalent tumours 9 due to both the perceived diminishing beneﬁt of adjuvant systemic therapy on long term survival as well as concerns about morbidity measures used to achieve local control at an older age Multivariate analysis also showed that patients with lower volume axillary disease fewer positive sentinel nodes relative to negative sentinel nodes were less likely to undergo axillary dissection This is consistent with known data on the reduced likelihood of additional positive nodes on axillary dissection for women with increasing numbers of negative sentinel nodes as reﬂected in nomograms used for predicting nonsentinel lymph node metastases 10 We did not have the data to assess the inﬂuence of size of nodal metastasis eg distinguishing between micrometastases and macrometastases on the decision to forego axillary dissection A similar pattern of foregoing cALND for SLN positive disease in this study has previously been observed overseas In a study of 97 314 patients from the National Cancer Data Base in the United States from 1998 to 2005 who underwent SLN biopsy and were then found to have nodal involvement 20 8 underwent SLN biopsy alone without a cALND 11 In that study multivariate analysis for the years 2004e2005 found that patients were signiﬁcantly more likely to undergo SLN biopsy alone if they were older had smaller tumours or were treated at noneNational Cancer Institutee designated cancer centres Similarly analysis of 239 661 women with operable breast cancer from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER cancer registry found that in pathologic node positive women who had SLN biopsy failure to undergo cALND increased from 20 in 1998 to 32 in 2004 and that omission of cALND was independently associated with smaller lowergrade tumours smaller size nodal metastasis and age 70 years 12 cALND for SLN negative patients An SLN negative result at the ﬁrst axillary operation is intended to preclude the need for cALND given its high negative predictive value Notwithstanding 10 3 of patients in this study proceeded to second axillary surgery despite a diagnosis of a negative SLN biopsy a pattern consistent throughout the study period Some of these women had isolated tumour cells ITC but the BQA does not collect data on ITC to further assess this The paper by Morris et al 8 similarly reported that 6 of patients with negative SLN went onto a second axillary operation which varies from the Australian and New Zealand guidelines to merely observe the axilla In our study multivariate analysis showed that patients with tumours sized 3 cm were twice as likely to proceed to subsequent axillary surgery following a negative SLN result as those with tumours 3 cm Other factors found to predict for subsequent axillary surgery among SLN negative patients included the presence of LVI higher tumour grade and younger age 40 years old all being commonly cited independent predictors for poorer prognosis Table 2 Surgeons would have been aware of these high risk factors either at the time or soon after the SLN biopsy The pattern of subsequent axillary surgery from 2006 to 2010 may help explain the decision making role of further axillary surgery after a negative SLN There may have for example been a requirement for cALND for surgeons performing SLN biopsy technique during their learning phase this explanation is supported by the observation in this series of a trend towards fewer second axillary surgeries for SLN negative patients across both tumour size cohorts during the study period Figs 1 and 2 Also what is not recorded in our data base is intra operative uncertainty about the robustness of the SLN procedure performed if the SLN is not convincing for technical reasons then the surgeon would be more likely to perform a cALND The high rates of positivity in the completion dissection when the SLN was negative is suggestive this may be a signiﬁcant factor The RACS Sentinel Node or Axillary Clearance SNAC trial 2 reported a false negative rates for SLN biopsy of 5 5 and negative predictive value 98 for sentinel node staging of the axilla It is noteworthy that the SNAC trial and others like it recruited only women with tumours 3 cm since in our study 9 of the women in the BQA underwent SLN based management despite their breast cancers measuring 3 cm SLN biopsy is currently not recommended by the Australian and New Zealand guidelines for tumours 3 cm given the lack of cancer outcomes from randomised trials in this group yet many surgeons internationally have nevertheless

interest or relevant funding source to declare Ethics approval Ethics approval was not required for this study Tumour characteristics of SLN negative patients before and after subsequent axillary surgery In this study 19 7 of all the SLN negative patients who were sub selected to undergo a second axillary operation were eventually upstaged to be node positive A focussed analysis of the tumour characteristics among all SLN negative patients was performed to explore the potential for a selection bias underlying both the decision to offer second axillary surgery for certain patient subsets despite a negative SLN result and subsequently ﬁnding positive nodes among them LVI is an established poor prognostic factor in breast cancer for locoregional recurrence and survival 15 Across both tumour size cohorts patients undergoing second axillary surgery after a negative SLN were found to have a signiﬁcantly higher average prevalence of LVI than those who did not proceed to a second operation 20 4 and 40 8 versus 13 0 and 23 4 respectively This is in keeping with the observation from the multivariate analysis that LVI was an independent predictor for second axillary surgery among SLN negative patients Furthermore the utility of interpreting LVI as an independent biological marker for increased likelihood of lymph node involvement seems to be borne out in the results of the cALND where those SLN negative patients in whom positive nodes were subsequently diagnosed had a higher prevalence of LVI than those who were conﬁrmed as still having no nodal metastases Conclusions According to the BQA data for 2006e2010 the Australian and New Zealand best practice recommendations for the treatment of the axilla for both positive and negative SLN biopsy results were adhered to in 79 8 and 89 7 of cases respectively Older age and lower sentinel node burden predicted no subsequent axillary surgery among initially SLN positive patients Young age higher grade LVI and larger tumour size predicted subsequent axillary surgery among initially SLN negative patients Patients who were initially SLN negative but subsequently found to have positive nodes after undergoing second axillary surgery had tumours that were associated with a higher prevalence of LVI This study forms an important part of the audit feedback loop in line with the aims of a quality audit and has
