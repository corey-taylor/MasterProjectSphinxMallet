Share Comment Follow TIMEPolitics On the eve of the 12th anniversary of the 9 11 terrorist attacks Barack Obama made the strongest possible case for the use of force against Bashar Assad s Syrian regime But it wasn t a very strong case Indeed it was built on a false premise We can stop children from being gassed to death he said after he summoned grisly images of kids writhing and foaming at the mouth and then dying on hospital floors Does he really think we can do that with a limited military strike or the rather tenuous course of diplomacy now being pursued We might not be able to do it even if we sent in 250 000 troops and got rid of Assad The gas could be transferred to terrorists most likely Hizballah before we would find all or even most of it And that is the essence of the policy problem Obama has been wrestling with on Syria when you explore the possibilities for intervention any vaguely plausible action quickly reaches a dead end The President knows this which makes his words and gestures during the weeks leading up to his Syria speech all the more perplexing He willingly jumped into a bear trap of his own creation In the process he has damaged his presidency and weakened the nation s standing in the world It has been one of the more stunning and inexplicable displays of presidential incompetence that I ve ever witnessed The failure cuts straight to the heart of a perpetual criticism of the Obama White House that the President thinks he can do foreign policy all by his lonesome This has been the most closely held American foreign policy making process since Nixon and Kissinger only there s no Kissinger There is no Ã©minence grise think of someone like Brent Scowcroft who can say to Obama with real power and credibility Mr President you re doing the wrong thing here Let s consider the consequences if you call the use of chemical weapons a red line Or Mr President how can you talk about this being the world s red line if the world isn t willing to take action Perhaps those questions and many others fell through the cracks as his first term national security staff departed and a new team came in But Obama has shown a desire to have national security advisers who were honest brokers people who relayed information to him rather than global strategists In this case his new staff apparently raised the important questions about going to Congress for a vote Do you really want to do this for a limited strike What if they say no But the President ignored them which probably means that the staff isn t strong enough MORE In Prime Time Obama Struggles to Reason With Nation Over Syria The public presentation of his policies has been left to the likes of Secretary of State John Kerry whose statements had to be refuted twice by the President in the Syria speech Kerry had said there might be a need for boots on the ground in Syria Obama No boots Kerry had said the military strikes would be unbelievably small Obama We don t do pinpricks Worst of all Kerry bumbled into prematurely mentioning a not very convincing Russian plan to get rid of the Syrian chemical weapons This had been under private discussion for months apparently the sort of dither that bad guys Saddam the Iranians Assad always use as a delaying tactic Kerry in bellicose mode seemed to be making fun of the idea and the Russians called him on it Kerry s staff tried to walk back this megagaffe calling it a rhetorical exercise As it stands no one will be surprised if the offer is a ruse but the Administration is now trapped into seeing it through and gambling that it will be easier to get a congressional vote if it fails Which gets close to the Obama Administration s problem there have been too many rhetorical exercises too many loose pronouncements of American intent without having game planned the consequences This persistent problem remember the President s needless and dangerous assertion that his policy wasn t the containment of the Iranian nuclear program has metastasized into a flurry of malarkey about Syria It s been two years since he said Assad must step aside He announced the red line and the world s red line And now We can stop children from being gassed The Chinese believe that the strongest person in the room says the least The President is the strongest person militarily in the world He does not have to broadcast his intentions He should convey them privately wait for a response then take action or not He should do what the Israelis did when they took out the Syrian nuclear reactor they did it without advance bluster and didn t even claim credit for it afterward The wolf doesn t have to cry wolf nor should the American eagle We must stand for restrained moral power power that is absolutely lethal and purposeful when it is unleashed but never unleashed wantonly without a precise plan or purpose Creating a precise plan in the Middle East is utterly impossible which is something the American people have clearly come to realize The region is at a hinge of history those straight line borders drawn by the Europeans nearly 100 years ago seem to have passed their sell by date The next decades may see the formation of new countries like Kurdistan along ethnic and sectarian lines and the process will undoubtedly be bloody Some version of Syria will probably emerge there s always been a Syria but perhaps not within the current borders The West will have to stand aside as this is worked out We have slashed our way into these places under the neocolonial assumption that they are somehow in need of our wisdom and power and left too much chaos and too many dead bodies in our wake to have any moral credibility left in the region except perhaps in Israel And you have to wonder if after the past few weeks the Israelis would trust us to provide the security for the peace that Kerry is trying to negotiate with the Palestinians Once again the President understands all this The subtext of his presidency has been that it is no longer possible for the U S to go it alone even if he continues to do so himself unless we face a direct and immediate threat to our national security and that we must build multilateral coalitions to enforce the world s red lines And so the question must be asked Why has he persisted in pursuing a limited military option in Syria These things almost never work Often they make the situation worse Ryan Crocker the retired American diplomat with the most experience in the region has speculated that Assad s diabolical response to an American military strike might be to launch another chemical attack just as a stick in our eye And then our next move Could the President let another gas attack stand MORE How to Destroy Syria s Chemical Weapons The President isn t crass or stupid enough to say it but I would guess that he is persisting in his public threats of military action because American credibility and more precisely his credibility really is at stake But playing the American credibility card is a foolish and extremely dangerous game In my lifetime more lives including American lives have been lost in the pursuit of American credibility than by any legitimate military factor It was what led Lyndon Johnson to double down in Vietnam It was what helped propel George W Bush into pulling the trigger in Iraq even after it was clear that most of the world and quietly the American military thought it would be a disastrous exercise It was what led Obama deeper into Afghanistan Make no mistake Obama has already lost credibility in the world given his performance of the past few weeks But American credibility is easily resurrected given our overwhelming strength by prudent action the next time a crisis erupts a clear strategic vision and a rock steady hand on the wheel It was resurrected by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s The sad thing is that Obama had been rebuilding our international stature after George W Bush s unilateral thrashing about He has now damaged his ability to get his way with the Chinese the Iranians and even the Israelis That may never come back and there were real opportunities to make some progress especially with Iran where the ascension of a nonprovocative President Hassan Rouhani and a reform minded Foreign Minister in Mohammed Javad Zarif had opened the possibility of real progress in the nuclear talks and maybe even in other areas like Afghanistan The question now is whether Obama s inability to make his military threat in Syria real and the American people s clear distaste for more military action will empower the hard liners in the Revolutionary Guards Corps to give no quarter in the negotiations The Chinese who have been covetous of the South China Sea oil fields may not be as restrained as they have been in the past The Japanese may feel the need to revive their military or even go nuclear now that the promise of American protection seems less reliable The consequences of Obama s amateur display ripple out across the world There are domestic consequences as well This was supposed to be the month when the nation s serious fiscal and budgetary problems were hashed out or not with the Republicans There was a chance that a coalition could be built to back a compromise to solve the debt ceiling problem and the quiet horrors caused by sequestration and to finally achieve a long term budget compromise But any deal would have required intense single minded negotiation including political protection or sweeteners for those Republicans who crossed the line Precious time has been wasted And after Syria it will be difficult for any member of Congress to believe that this President will stick to his guns or provide protection There are those who say Obama has destroyed his presidency It may be true but I doubt it All sorts of things could happen to turn the tide back in his favor The snap polls after the Syria speech indicate that he still has the ability to sell an argument however briefly He has been lucky in his opponents the Republicans will doubtless continue to take positions that most Americans find foolish or extreme Obamacare may prove a success He may make crisp decisions in the next overseas crisis one would hope he s learned something from this one But he has done himself and the nation great and unnecessary harm The road back to credibility and respect will be extremely difficult Read more http swampland time com 2013 09 11 obama and syria stumbling toward damascus ixzz2j6xFj6AH
