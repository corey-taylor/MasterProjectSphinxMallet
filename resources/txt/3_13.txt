1 The Hollow Promise of Better Democracy through the Transformative and Competitive Power of E government in Canada Politics Web 2 0 An International Conference New Political Communications Unit Royal Holloway University of London Presentation April 17 2008 Kirsten Kozolanka Assistant Professor School of Journalism and Communication Carleton University Introduction Canada has a reputation as a world wide leader in e government For several years it received a Number 1 world ranking from Accenture a global management consulting company Public Works Canada 2004 p 1 The Canada website was also mentioned by the United Nations E government Readiness Report in 2005 as a best practice in government websites Human Resources Canada 2005 p 5 The e government project in Canada has undoubted successes a large number of services now on line or accessible through call centres high public satisfaction with service delivery and rapid implementation of the e government project My argument however is that the promise of better democracy through the transformation and competitive power of e government has not been realized Flawed from its inception and mismanaged it has shifted services but has not met its own early rhetoric of transformative governance Moreover e government in Canada is first and foremost a political not a democratic project As I will demonstrate it privileges politicized privatized promotional and commercialized interests over the public interest of better democracy Key to my argument is the understanding that Canada as a geographically large country with a population both dispersed and hugging the US border has always relied on communication and technology for nation building It has continued to use this technological nationalism Charland 1986 p 197 along with technological determinism in communications policy making most recently in the Government OnLine project that began in 1999 Technological determinism and nationalism together with the political privileging of market interests over the public interest have resulted in what I call the new TINA a concept those here in the UK will be familiar with In this case it involves the construction once again in Canada s history of a discourse and a policy for which there is no alternative In other words the task for e government was to embrace the transformative power of technological innovation in order to avert crisis in the form of a competitive threat from outside the country the United States and a threat to sovereignty 2 from inside the country the ongoing struggle to keep the country united geographically and culturally Young 2003 p 216 These were not new threats but their invocation whenever used resonates with Canadians steeped in a history of nation building through communication Significant changes in state policy that emanated from New Right politics occurred later in Canada than it did in the UK and the US These included restructuring of government through drastic reductions in spending and privatization of services During the same period of time in the mid 1990s Canada was beginning to address the need for new ICT policy The same New Right political and market forces that had successfully lobbied for government downsizing and restructuring now positioned e government as enabling the government to meet its target of streamlined administration and lower labour costs Prior to what Canada called the Government On Line project several major policy advisory councils set up by the government established and intensified the market s hold on ICTs In each case private industry was given the lead in recommending the direction that ICT policy should take Overall the result was that government facilitated ICT development with funding but industry actually led it Barney 2004 pp 96 102 Despite this market activism and leadership on the ICT policy agenda the government claimed that e government was a response to concerns about its declining relationship with citizens Strangely for a government concerned with what has been called a democratic deficit it chose repeatedly to design a policy making process that curtailed or ignored citizen participation either by not holding public hearings or not including citizens in advisory council membership As Barney says ICT policy in Canada instead has reflected the priority of unfettered technological innovation and growth and a complementary determination to develop these technologies in ways that maximize their potential as media of industry commerce and economic accumulation Barney 2004 p 104 Government On Line Initial communication from the government on the Government On Line project characterized it as transformative and good for democracy It was first mentioned in the Speech from the Throne in 1999 in which the goal was established as making Canada the most connected country in the world with the explicit purpose of bringing Canadians together In other words the project was another nation building exercise It started with the Clerk of the Privy Council giving a speech about engaging Canadians and modernizing the relationship between governments and citizens in ways that would allow citizens to shape policies and decisions Privy Council Office 1998 p 1 In 2000 Lucienne Robillard the minister responsible for Government On Line said The government of Canada believes that new communications technologies will invigorate public discourse and strengthen the trend towards democracy around the world Treasury Board of Canada 2000 p 1 But Robillard also articulated a different vision of what the relationship between government and citizens would look like She said The Internet is making it possible to 3 provide programs and services in a more efficient results oriented and cost effective manner p 1 She also referred to a skilled and trained workforce p 1 and the need to embrace innovation and making a commitment to continuous learning p 4 As we have come to realize these phrases are New Public Management code for cutting labour costs and allowing for business flexibility goals in keeping with New Right reinvention of government The market aspect of the project was further emphasized in the first report from the EBusiness Opportunities Roundtable The roundtable was set up in 2000 by Industry Canada to champion e business initiatives and policy changes Canada 2003 p 1 The report stressed the urgency of Canada not remaining complacent about e business but to aggressively rise to the challenge or risk falling behind other advanced economies Boston Consulting Group 2000 p 2 As it had with previous industry led reports on ICTs the government accepted and acted on the roundtable s recommendations A later statement by one of the roundtable s co chairs got to the heart of the emerging business government partnership in ICT policymaking He said We need to stimulate economic growth by investing more in moving government online Not only would this be an effective use of taxpayers money the work of designing those systems would fall to Canadian business Government On Line Canada 2004 p 2 In this statement we see the conflation of the benefits to Canadians with the benefits to business The Government On Line project was moving with great speed at this point The government allocation for the entire project was 880 million or 440 million pounds In 2001 Bell Nexxia received a 57 million competitive contract to establish the Secure Channel infrastructure for the project Public Works Canada 2001 Accenture the management consulting company that ranked Canada as Number 1 in the world in egovernment received 100 000 in contracts Access to Information 2005 Between 2001 and 2002 both companies made substantial political donations to the Liberal Party of Canada which was in power at the time Elections Canada 2002 By this point the Auditor General of Canada was scrutinizing the project closely and produced three critical reports over four years One report said there has never been a comprehensive well articulated strategy or a consolidated strategic plan for the initiative Auditor General 2004 p 6 Another report focused on Secure Channel s poor level of security its huge cost overruns and long delays in implementation It questioned the lack of clear measurement criteria as well as the ability of the government to sustain large high risk projects that would require large amounts of public funding over a long period of time 2006 p 27 Media reaction to the Auditor General s several reports was muted if not virtually nonexistent The few media stories on Government On line that have appeared were mostly in business news and tended to uphold rhetoric of technological utopia competition and the dire consequences of not moving ahead quickly with the project One such story said technology industry leaders warn that the delay in launching the federal government 4 into cyberspace could knock Canada out of the race to become a world leader in the burgeoning Internet economy May 2000 p F5 In another story a business leader recommended the government slip back into deficit if necessary to fund an economic stimulus package that includes spending on Internet infrastructure and technology research and development Vardy 2001 p 2 In this environment of technological determinism in which even the tax and deficit cutting economic goals of the New Right can be temporarily set aside there was very little media analysis of the Auditor General s criticisms Service Canada The government moved ahead with its plan to create one government department that would be responsible for all aspects of electronic service delivery to Canadians through single window access In late 2005 Service Canada was created marking the official end of the Government On Line project The universalization of business imperatives with citizenship needs was evident in the department s stated approach as it prepared to become Service Canada Better quality of service contributes to higher satisfaction among citizens High quality and cost effective services reduce costs for business and individuals and increase the efficiency of government operations helping to make Canada a better place to live Human Resources and Social Development Canada 2005 p 2 Service Canada has not been without its detractors The Conservatives expressed concern calling it another ineffective bureaucracy but that was when they were in political opposition O Neil 2005 p 1 The Privacy Commissioner echoed the Auditor General s concerns over the security of electronic information arguing that privacy must be built into the design stages of the new technology and systems Office of the Privacy Commissioner 2006 pp 10 11 The union for government employees the Public Service Alliance of Canada said between 10 and 30 thousand jobs could be affected with changes including relocation redeployment or layoffs CBC News 2005a p 1 Accountability both to labour and to the public was another issue after one of Canada s most well known experts in access to information charged that the project hid o ne of the most radical and secretive overhauls of the federal public service Rubin 2005 p 42 A document received through an access to information request showed that the government was looking into opportunities for alternative service delivery privatization and outsourcing p 42 The government was also criticized for putting in charge of Service Canada a senior public employee who was known as a political trouble shooter O Neil 2005 p 1 This signalled that Service Canada was a key political initiative for the government It was so significant in fact that promotional language and activity permeated the whole project from the beginning Back in 2001 the minister responsible for Government On Line said Our government has made a longstanding commitment to using and deploying information and communications technology in all facets of Canadian society In fact we have made it almost a trademark or a brand to make Canada one of the most connected countries in the world Treasury Board 2001 p 1 This reveals how Government OnLine was a promotional vehicle to enhance the reputation of the government nationally 5 and globally To reinforce the brand the project had to be promoted thus the government undertook considerable polling and advertising In all over 2 1 2 years Service Canada conducted 24 national surveys Service Canada 2007 p 1 but its polling mostly focused on client satisfaction levels with service The government has also conducted extensive ongoing advertising campaigns to sell the convenience and ease of getting services no doubt based on a survey finding that less than half of Canadians were aware of Service Canada s existence Phoenix Strategic Perspectives p 4 Its initial national awareness campaign may have cost up to 1 million Public Works Canada 2007 p 7 Service Canada s first annual report was in effect promotional literature It was in full colour with lavish use of large photographs Service Canada 2006 p 19 This ran counter to the government s own communication publishing policy The text itself is rife with the language of New Public Management as exemplified in the vision statement To achieve better outcomes for Canadians through service excellence p 8 The report repeatedly reminds Canadians what the government is doing to put citizens first and how much is being saved and implies that it is eliminating fraud and waste p 17 In addition the text repeatedly mentions Canadians and citizens but both words are used in a way that clearly means clients Given the promotional nature of the whole report and the polling and advertising conducted on e government citizens are now also being treated as consumers of information Conclusion The Government On Line project in Canada has been successful in rapidly implementing the delivery of a large variety and number of services to Canadians either on line or through call centres Many remaining issues such as privacy security labour and accountability will only intensify with time if left unresolved While other countries may face similar challenges some of the current issues had to do with the way in which egovernment in Canada was conceived organized and implemented Canada s experience with e government owed much to its history of using communication and technology deterministically for the hegemonic purpose of nationbuilding Equally it relied on New Right market based politics to give it the language advice and experience to propel it forward while the state provided the funding Increasingly the government eschewed public consultation and participation in ICT development and embraced the private sector s perspective of imminent crisis unless its market based prescription was followed Thus e government in Canada became the new TINA there is no alternative not only to technological development but also to a particular manner of development E government was privatized through contracts to the private sector to build the infrastructure and to provide the contract labour that replaced or redeployed public employees It was promotional as the government sought to use the project to enhance its reputation at home as a united and connected nation as well as abroad as a world leader and in the process needed to sell its e government brand to citizens It was politicized as the government awarded large contracts to private sector companies that also donated to the political party in power and by the government s own goal of cutting public sector spending Finally it was commercialized as e government assumed a business orientation and reduced citizenship to service transactions as 6 consumers Even the shift from the project name of Government On Line to Service Canada in its implementation phase betrays how divorced it became from e democracy and has instead become e service The Canadian government made the error of equating access to technology with better democracy and thus conflated citizenship with service Once again in Canada s history government has succeeded in averting the presumed threat to the nation but it has not addressed the central problem of democratic citizenship Thus e government in Canada is exposed as a political rather than democratic project one that has not lived up to its initial promise of better democracy References Auditor General of Canada 2004 February Report of the
