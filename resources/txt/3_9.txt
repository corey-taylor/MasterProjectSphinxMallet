Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 Web2 0 under the Actor Network Theory point of view conceptualization and deﬁnition analysis Abstract Actor Network Theory ANT has been used amongst others to support research related to Community of Practices COP theory considering such groups as outcomes of the relations between each of their networks and agents human material or whatever Fox 2000 The evolutionary trends observed on the Internet and especially the emergence of User Generated Content UGC is profoundly inﬂuenced by the rise of new types of relations between actors on the World Wide Web Existing theories and concepts do not adequately frame these trends where one may notice a lack of stable definitions and literature related to the so called Web2 0 Kolbitsch and Maurer 2006 This paper aims to apply the ANT approach to the Web 2 0 trends It is argued that new formats of online sources weblogs wikis podcasts social networks and ﬁle sharing platforms have lately reached a critical mass in term of usage and have impacted the informational landscape by stressing the blurring boundaries between information producers and consumers Picone 2006 Our methodology consists of a collection of Web2 0 related deﬁnitions found both in academic and professional literature The collected deﬁnitions are then discursively deconstructed according to their dimensions and components Quivy and Van Campenhoudt 2002 The assumption of this method is that deﬁnitions or descriptions of Web2 0 as a concept focus mainly on the effects and consequences on the informational landscape By considering the simpliﬁcation and punctualization processes described by Law Law 1992 this paper intends to formalize the heterogeneous networks lying behind the eﬀects studied Our research supports that Web2 0 formats may be considered as the eﬀect of diﬀerent types of networks from the ANT point of view This paper illustrates that amongst all factors leading to the web 2 0 eﬀect improving the ease of use through content creation software and accessibility are fundamental in the emergence of the Web2 0 trend in addition to the interpersonal facilities that they oﬀer so often emphasized by its evangelists Jeremy Depauw PhD Student Information Communication Sciences Université Libre de Bruxelles Contact details jdepauw ulb ac be Phone 003226504454 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 Yet another deﬁnition Web 2 0 is phrase that raises a lot of challenges and opportunities for a wide range of stakeholders such as users marketers scholars etc Plenty of authors academic or not have taken the initiative to describe and deﬁne that phrase From a marketing buzzword it has gained some critical mass and has proved very useful to describe some kind of evolution trend on the Internet Almost three years after O Reilly s coming out about Web2 0 O Reilly 2005 few would doubt that there is large scale shift on the informational landscape and especially on the internet Ho irchner et al 2007 The concern of Academia has grown Many creative and path breaking works papers books PhD projects etc focus on Web 2 0 either as subject or as context It is then surprising that any of them can rely on a common stable accepted and eﬀective theoretical frame Safran Guetl Helic The phrase Web 2 0 refers to an object widely accepted and understood as a useful if imperfect conceptual umbre a under which analysts marketers and other stakeholders in the tech ﬁeld could huddle the new generation of internet applications and businesses that were emerging om the participatory web as we know it today Madden Fox 2006 Part of a broader theoretical investigation this paper aims to highlight the key elements that are usually pointed out to deﬁne and to describe Web 2 0 More than yet another deﬁnition it reports an analytical reading of a deﬁnitions corpus found in both academic literature and on the web and intends to conceptualize the dimensions and components of what it is supposed to be It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel because most of the work has already been done whereas few sustainable sociological investigations are available Beer Burrows 2007 By centralizing their work on a single review and analysis this paper tries to take the best of authors from disparate ﬁelds with diverse if not divergent purposes This is an attempt to take part in the eﬀort To achieve this goal Actor Network Theory has been chosen as theoretical framework providing a useful approach and analytical tools Actor Network Theory as a useful theoretical ame Elements of deﬁnitions and descriptions of Web 2 0 are considered here as indicators of the components and dimensions of the conceptualization in progress Such an approach has been inspired and hopefully justiﬁed by the choice of Actor Network Theory ANT as theoretical framework ANT has been proven as a reliable and appropriate frame to understand and analyze complex phenomena and objects Tuomi 2000 Back to the basics In the Actor Network Theory s analytical frame also known as Sociology of Translation reality is observed through interactions Reality is all that there is and is considered as the eﬀects of heterogeneous networks made up of society organizations groups machines etc Indeed ANT Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 2 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 theorists consider these items as the eﬀects of patterned networks Law 1992 In order to cope with the complexity of reality ANT authors have built two major processes simpliﬁcation and punctualization They consist of reducing the network to a limited number of elements The most complex objects may be analyzed as black boxes This helps to deal with the complexity of their interactions that constitute the observed reality On the one hand simpliﬁcation consists of the fact of reducing the network to one or two of its eﬀects which allow to not considering it a set of interacting material agents etc Law gives the example of a television set As long as it works properly it appears as a device for watching TV shows But if it breaks down and need to be repaired it becomes a very complicated network of wires chips etc On the other hand punctualization comes from the fact of taking usual and working networks for granted Law explains that punctualized resources are such because they are usual easily performed and managed They are then put under the simpliﬁcation process taking them only for their eﬀect as granted Law 1992 More than a generic framework for understanding social phenomena the use of ANT oﬀers views and shapes that will guide and support the analysis of such a complex and multidimensional object as Web 2 0 Inside the black box Callon 1991 proposes a set of three elements that constitutes what is referred to as a network the intermediary and the actor that shapes the network I argue that the key of my analysis resides in this triptych An intermediary is anything passing between actors which deﬁnes the relationship between them Callon 1991 p 134 Callon gives examples such as computer software as well as scientiﬁc papers or human bodies From this point of view a major problem in understanding Web2 0 is resolved The notion of intermediary may be used here to identify any technical and material forms of content Depending on the background the point of view or the beliefs of authors Web 2 0 is sometimes deﬁned as a trend as a practice or as a technical artifact with diﬀerent level of abstraction The notion of intermediaries avoids the incompatibility of views and supports joint analysis As Callon writes intermediaries both order and form the medium of the networks they describe Callon 1991 p 135 Furthermore the relevance is even greater when he proposes a typology of intermediaries that shape most of the networks i Text is the ﬁrst one that may be seen as an object that makes connections with other texts Applied to Web 2 0 the statement of texts as intermediaries is valuable Technical artifacts are a second kind of networks and complement conveniently this ﬁrst type Callon explains that a technical artifact may be treated as a program of actions coordinating network of roles played by human or non human 1991 p 136 Indeed if the approach of intermediaries had been limited to texts the use of ANT would have forced me to i i e Literary inscription texts technical objects skills and money Interested readers will ﬁnd a full an comprehensive description of them and nuanced element on intermediaries in Callon 1991 pp 135 140 Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 3 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 ignore all the descriptions of Web 2 0 that do not highlight the content as a primary dimension By including technical artifacts as part of shaping elements of networks the use of ANT s analytical framework is conﬁrmed as relevant Actors deﬁne one another by means of the intermediaries they put into circulation Callon 1991 They have to be treated carefully regarding their relationship with intermediaries Callon adds that they are any entity able to associate texts human beings non humans objects and money They may be collective or individual sets of entities that assume some authority in enacting intermediaries Callon explains that the limit between intermediaries and actors is blurring and suggests that their division is purely practical Actors are entities which take the last generation of intermediaries and transform them by creating the next generation This view applied to Web 2 0 analysis invites us to stress the importance of decoding what elements are intermediaries and what others are actors The growing role of users in the content production process raises questions about the place they have to take in the descriptions and deﬁnitions ANT s theoretical position considers reality as made up of the eﬀects of patterned networks that take a material form thanks to intermediaries and actors Law 1992 Then a groups actors and intermediaries describe networks and deﬁne other groups actors and intermediaries together with the relationships that bring these together Callon 1991 p 142 Latour suggests tracing the associations when he claims for a redeﬁnition of Sociology He promotes it as a Science that studies the type of connections between things that are not social rather than a Science that studies things among other things Latour 2005 p 4 He argues that the observation of the social can only be achieved by tracking the traces it leaves when an association is being produced between elements Latour 2005 p 8 This suggests considering the conceptualization of Web 2 0 as a track for the traces its leaves in deﬁnitions This track is the methodological basis of this paper Web 2 0 and ANT making the step This short introduction to the Actor Network Theory has highlighted the tools of my analysisii of Web 2 0 deﬁnitions and descriptions On the one hand I argue that combining the notions of simpliﬁcation and punctualization provides a relevant framework to tackle Web 2 0 The term covers a too complex and too diverse phenomenon formats tools usages look and feel etc The black box eﬀect of ANT frame appears to be a crucial analytical tool On the other hand for the purpose of this analysis it will be necessary to deconstruct the components and dimensions of Web 2 0 This is where the ANT s triptych actors intermediaries and networks comes in handy This paper takes then the opportunity to propose an analysis of a collection of descriptions and deﬁnitions of Web 2 0 based on the alternative call of these theoretical tools ii I follow Callon s description of its elements as a set of analytical tools for exploring the mechanisms by which heterogeneous activities are brought into a relationship with one another 1991 p 133 Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 4 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 Toward a conceptual analysis of Web 2 0 A concept is a theoretical construct that aims to rely on an observed reality Quivy Van Campenhoudt 2006 When faced with complexity concepts need to be decomposed as a set of dimensions Each dimension is formed by components which themselves need to be observed through indicators 2006 p 115 This approach is crucial as it supports the use of the analytical tools of ANT The analysis of Web 2 0 deﬁnitions and descriptions has been achieved through a funnel shaped methodology Starting from a collection as large as possible of any details indicators traces of what authors academic or not have used to describe their understanding of Web 2 0 Step by step this analysis proposes extracting the core ideas First a set of deﬁnitions has been collected from both the academic literature and popular discourses on the Internet Websites blogs papers books any type of material has been considered Regarding the huge number of results given by search engines to the request Web 2 0 deﬁnition the corpus of deﬁnitions does not seek exhaustiveness Secondly the deﬁnitions and descriptions have been gathered in a single document iii For each author the key elements of their content have been identiﬁed and decomposed The third step consisted of organizing and linking these elements of deﬁnition and highlighting components and dimensions according to the frame usual typologies and structure of descriptions of ANT A new document has been created for that purpose that aggregates deﬁnition and leads to a ﬁnal conceptualization One of the beneﬁts of ANT s analytical frame comes from the fact that elements of deﬁnitions may be use as indicators to highlight intermediaries actors and eﬀects following the traces they leave in authors descriptions of Web 2 0 Uncovering the dimensions of Web 2 0 Discourse about Web 2 0 often refers to two core sources O Reilly O Reilly 2005 and Wikipedia see Web 2 0 entry in Wikipedia Who could propose a better deﬁnition of Web 2 0 than the initial creator of the phrase on the one hand and a wide community of users on the Internet on the other The former has posted a long entry on O Reilly Media s website describing what was initially meant by the phrase Web 2 0 The main interests of that initiative do not come in my opinion from its details as such Personally I think that if O Reilly and his colleagues have pointed out lots of interesting points it was at that time too early to rely on them exclusively However this work brings one important structuring aspect O Reilly explained that the concept of web 2 0 was intended to function as a core set of principles and practices that applied to common threads and tendencies observed across many technologies pointed out in Madden Fox 2006 It suggests a structure of Web 2 0 in three sets principles and practices threads and tendencies and iii Each author is identiﬁed as a single subject The elements of the deﬁnition are then organized in levels and sub levels of a mind map in order to structure and guide the analysis of deﬁnitions Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 5 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 technologies tools iv Described as such O Reilly posed them as main dimensions of Web 2 0 This may be illustrated by applying this reading grid to the Wikipedia deﬁnition Web 2 0 is a trend in the use of World Wide Web technology and web design that aims to facilitate creativity information sharing and most notably co aboration among users These concepts have led to the development and evolution of web based communities and hosted services such as social networking sites wikis blogs and folksonomies Figure 1 Wikipedia entry of Web 2 0 The main observation is that every sense making element of the formulation ﬁt in one and only one dimension Without losing the initial meaning the typology of sets taken from O Reilly s work happened to be a promising analytical structure The sets are potential dimensions for this conceptualization This process was then applied to every deﬁnition and description collected regardless of the background and the position of the source Following this approach the initial document that gathered all elements of Web 2 0 descriptions was taken as starting point and ordered according to the dimensions Again most of them ﬁt in one of the sets The redundant elements were merged or splited carefully and a brand new map was generated presenting all the indicators of Web 2 0 in the dimensions However as such it was not structured enough to usefully conceptualize Web2 0 Discovering Web 2 0 components Following Quivy and Van Campenhoudt s guidelines the missing step of the analysis was the identiﬁcation of components Creating additional categories of indicators in every set on the basis of traces of Web 2 0 in the corpus fulﬁlled this needv Peter Mechant has proposed a very interesting contribution to the debate about the Web 2 0 and Social Software deﬁnition achieved through a qualitative research with international experts in the ﬁelds of e learning social software and Web 2 0 Mechant 2007 Although Mechant s approach rejects the use of the phrase Web 2 0 preferring Social So ware he proposes a conceptualization that helps the purpose of this analysis He suggests that distinguishing diﬀerent dimensions of social software is one of iv The word tools will be used rather than technologies It is argued that the former will ﬁt better to the typology Its broader meaning could avoid any epistemological questions especially related to technological determinism v Some references are given as illustration of authors who have treated Web 2 0 as on particular dimension and components Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 6 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 the keys providing a amework that a ows a more subtle approach to them His work points out to four dimensions shared to some extent by most social applications Content management Communication Collaboration Community Whereas this typology of dimensions is relevant I argue that the complexity of the reality covered by Web 2 0 needs dimensions on a broader level of abstraction The references to sets suggested earlier intends to deﬁne a broader level of details in the collection of deﬁnitions Therefore Mechant s dimensions may enrich the analysis in leading to components discovery and should be adapted to the ongoing conceptualization When analyzing the indicators in each dimension three components appeared to be applied content management and communication co aboration and technology Here content management and communication have been merged because they are too closely linked in indicators Components of the dimension a set of tools Content Management and Communication Mechant deﬁnes content management as the functions in social software that enable users to create and manage content for personal use or gain In addition I suggest adding the Communication dimension that he describes as the role of assistance in the exchange of information between people I argue that according to the deﬁnitions analyzed here splitting those components is not necessary in regard to their close links In this dimension it is probably the most obvious group of indicators It gathers all the references to online formats that are usually used to describe Web 2 0 The main formats cited by authors are weblogs wikis podcast M Boulos Maramba Wheeler 2006 K Boulos Maged Wheeler Steve 2007 Peek 2005 Thomas 2006 Beer Burrows 2007 ﬁle sharing and social networking platforms Kolbitsch Maurer 2006 Wikipedia Gilchrist also cites weblogs and wikis and suggest RSS as well Gilchrist 2007 Notess 2005 To some extent some authors consider instant messaging as another format Thomas 2006 Compared to Mechant s understanding of content management the use of this dimension emphasizes more the creation than the management of content which is addressed below Collaboration In this set the collaboration component is still technology driven Anyway its indicators have been diﬀerentiated because they cannot be considered as content publication tools It is their potential function of enablers of cooperation with a person or agency that motivates their classiﬁcation following Mechant s typology The major elements here are collaborative ﬁltering M Boulos et al 2006 social bookmarking M Boulos et al 2006 Gilchrist 2007 folksonomies and tagging M Boulos et al 2006 Gilchrist 2007 Thomas 2006 Wikipedia Allen Rosenbaum Shachaf 2007 Beer Burrows 2007 mashups social search engines and multimedia content Picone 2007 K Boulos et al 2007 Technology This group of indicators in deﬁnitions does not cope with any of the four dimensions in Mechant s work This happens to be a broader component in the sense that Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 7 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 it brings together indicators that do not describe a unique feature but refer to more general technical settings However they cannot be ignored or classiﬁed in another dimension I propose Technology as the component that reﬂects the roots of Web 2 0 tools It gathers traces in deﬁnitions that describe Web 2 0 as Internet based Skiba Tamas Robinson 2006 O Reilly said the web as platform transparent technology M Boulos et al 2006 a next generation of web based software and service or platform Economist Intelligence Unit 2007 Components of the dimension a set of principles and practices This dimension diﬀers from the previous one as it takes a step back from the concrete aspect of indicators Although it is widely accepted that Web 2 0 is technology driven there has been rapidly a wide agreement on the fact its beneﬁt come from the use made of these tools Tools as such do not shape Web 2 0 In deﬁnitions and description of Web 2 0 authors often refer to a set of uses It aims to highlight what are the beneﬁts and the major applications that are made of the set of tools This is probably where Mechant s dimensions help more the analysis Content Management coupled with Communication Co aboration and Community Content management and Communication Again content management and Communication appears to be a useful and eﬀective component It brings together indicators related to practices and principles on content generation and its transformation The major type of traces in Web 2 0 deﬁnitions refers to User Generated Content see for example Musser O Reilly 2006 Peek 2005 Anderson 2007 Heath Motta 2008 Content produced under the label Web 2 0 is mainly considered as user generated This indicator is often linked or referred to by phrases such as anyone can publish or anytime anywhere Holtz 2006 Gilchrist 2007 In addition the principles of read write web ﬁts in this group Musser O Reilly 2006 MacManus 2005 Those elements reﬂect either the communication or the content management aspect of the component On a more content oriented side other indicators in deﬁnitions highlight an increased ability to create manage and control information Typically examples of cited practices are monitoring remixing sharing reusing retargeting structuring etc Kolbitsch Maurer 2006 M Boulos et al 2006 Govekar 2006 This component is then very important because it covers most of the major users practices Collaboration This component aims to bring together elements referring to the creation of knowledge or added value when applying Web 2 0 practices Whereas it is still relevant at the user level it does not ﬁt in the dimension of trends In the ﬁrst dimension this component gathers technical elements of collaboration Here collaborative practices are observed and identiﬁed as speciﬁc to Web 2 0 It is an important axis of diﬀerentiation that builds Web 2 0 s speciﬁcity Examples of such indicators are direct references to collaboration Angrignon Kellet Ralston 2006 Beer Burrows 2007 Dybwad 2005 Holtz 2006 etc Maness 2006 participation in the structure and the content Musser O Reilly 2006 Birdsall 2007 Heath Motta 2008 conversation Holtz 2006 Angrignon et al 2006 etc Community When they focus on the interaction itself instead of the common building process of content the indicators seem best suited in the Community dimension Mechant Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 8 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 suggests a very broad understanding of community indicating the creation and maintenance of online communities and networks Indicators in deﬁnitions and description cover a wide scope in that component Direct references to communities are numerous Kolbitsch Maurer 2006 Angrignon et al 2006 They are often deﬁned by traces such as connection interactivity M Boulos et al 2006 Gilchrist 2007 etc passion or self regulation As direct corollaries of the Community crowd sourcing P Anderson 2007 Wikipedia informed leadership cumulative learning and collective intelligence are highlighted Angrignon et al 2006 Components of the dimension a set of threads and tendencies This dimension is quite important but also not easy to handle It gives Web 2 0 its importance as a trend and conﬁrms the need for a theoretically grounded concept Authors do not hesitate to pose Web 2 0 on an even broader scale than tools and practices Some describe it as an online trend or as a state of mind an attitude Birdsall 2007 or even as a philosophy Hoegg Martignoni Meckel Stanoevska Slabeva It is considered as powerful cheap fast and developing at an incredible change of scale Angrignon et al 2006 Others see it as the main engine of a major shift in the informational landscape Kolbitsch Maurer 2006 McAfee 2008 Thomas 2006 or even as a social movement Birdsall 2007 Le Deuﬀ able to realize a logic that was not achieved during the previous ages of the Internet No matter the exaggerated enthusiasm that sometimes appears Web 2 0 as a trend has to be taken into account Again applying the same typology of components is helpful for the understanding and analysis of indicators Content Management and Communication This component is made up of indicators that highlight further its consequences on a wide level of abstraction It oﬀers the opportunity to reveal important indicators When discussing its impact on content and communication authors describe Web 2 0 as open Safran et al dynamic Maness 2006 easy to use McAfee 2008 and media intensive Skiba et al 2006 It is assumed to require a low level of technical skills anyone can publish and access content anytime anywhere K Boulos et al 2007 Holtz 2006 In doing so it oﬀers opportunities such as bottom up communication Kolbitsch Maurer 2006 allowed by a drastic reduction of the boundaries between consumer and producer of information Picone 2007 Content publishing logic overcomes webpage creation and the quantity of data increases drastically T Anderson 2006 Peek 2005 which implies major shifts in practices and requirement for all kind of stakeholders Collaboration When describing Web 2 0 as a trend deﬁnitions highlight collaboration as a major outcome More than a set of practices or principles it is pointed out in order to explain and support important attributes Even if sometimes users compete Allen et al 2007 Web 2 0 is described as easily M Boulos et al 2006 collaborative Angrignon et al 2006 Govekar 2006 Holtz 2006 Maness 2006 etc and proﬁtable Skiba et al 2006 Knowledge created by the community is larger and stronger than the sum of the individuals knowledge because they cooperate Community Linked to the previous components Community is a useful vantage point to gather indicators that highlight the social aspect that Web 2 0 may involve when it is Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 9 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 described on the tendency level Sometimes compared to an ant colony Kolbitsch Maurer 2006 it takes its legitimacy and regulation from the wisdom Gilchrist 2007 and power of crowds P Anderson 2007 In addition traces in deﬁnition indicate that the Web 2 0 is user centric Birdsall 2007 Musser O Reilly 2006 and may be easily personalized so it makes computing social Holtz 2006 MacManus 2005 Musser O Reilly 2006 Skiba et al 2006 Designing Web 2 0 as a concept The funnel shaped analysis achieved so far provides a analytical vision of what deﬁnitions and descriptions may cover However is has to be considered as more than just a compilation Back to the toolbox identiﬁed earlier by Actor Network Theory s frameworkvi I see an opportunity to strengthen the theoretical value of this attempt As a reminder the simpliﬁcation process consists of the fact of reducing a complex network to some of its eﬀects It is according to this that Web 2 0 was posed as a black box concept that needed to be analyzed It justiﬁed the collection of deﬁnitions as raw material In the analysis process punctualization has revealed itself to be very useful for handling the wide scope of inputs brought by indicators Again the complexity of the reality covered by Web 2 0 as a concept is so large that it could not have been possible to deconstruct every element of the deﬁnitions This prevented me from deﬁning every single indicator A closer look at the compilation of indicators laid out in this paper highlights the dimensions of Web 2 0 from a low to a high level of abstraction Again this has been inﬂuenced by the use of ANT s toolbox The ﬁrst two sets are based on relatively non problematic elements Either the set of tools or the set of practices have been analyzed thanks to the simpliﬁcation process The large amount of indicators has been reduced to a minimal amount of their eﬀects allowing them to be analyzed In addition the third set has also been enriched by the beneﬁts of punctualization Here this process allowed me to take the eﬀects of the ﬁrst dimensions for granted and eﬀectively analyze this meta level Yet a major aspect of the conceptualization is still missing What are the actual relations between the dimensions The triptych elaborated brieﬂy in this paper might ﬁll in the gap Callon 1991 To sum up this theoretical tool as Callon presented it allows me to deﬁne networks observed object as eﬀects initiated by interacting actors mobilizing intermediaries By the time Web 2 0 concept is considered as the analyzed network Techno economic network would have said Callon its deﬁnition could be structured as such a black box a network that shapes the eﬀects of interacting actors and intermediaries O Reilly s typology of sets has the merit of proposing an analytical view of the concept that distinguishes the level of detail and the vantage point from which it will be addressedvii I argue that the conceptualization of Web 2 0 may be ﬁnalized by applying explicitly the ANT s triptych vi Simpliﬁcation black box and punctualization processes to cope with the complexity of the observed reality ANT s triptych intermediaries agents and networks vii Whereas Peter Mechant built a very complete insight to the concept the dimensions he proposed were too transversal to structure completely the concept Nevertheless as components they appeared as useful and valuable Jeremy Depauw PhD Student ULB Belgium 10 Politics Web 2 0 an International Conference 17 18 April 2008 The set of tools dimension is the more concrete and refers to actual technologies formats tools gadgets etc The indicators here are intended to explain the technical architecture and content production process in general regardless of the implication for the users or the ﬁeld I suggest then that this set of tools is also a set of intermediaries Indeed they order and form the medium of the network they describe As elaborated earlier in this paper either text or technical artifacts may be considered as intermediaries and this is precisely the central focus of indicators in this dimension The set of principles and practices dimension takes some steps back and considers less tangible aspects according to the indicators identiﬁed in it By pointing to actual practices on content transformation sharing etc and interaction either on collaboration or on community driven intentions this dimension put the user at the centre of attention From user to actor there is a small step that I propose to take Therefore this set is also the realm of actors Actors deﬁne one another by means of the intermediaries they put into circulation this dimension gather elements of deﬁnition that precisely overtakes the description of intermediaries and poses entities human or not that assume authority in activating intermediaries Again it is important to bear in mind that the boundary between intermediaries and actors is thin In the set of principles and practices the indicators point out precisely to entities that create new generations of intermediaries from the previous ones However any indicator of that dimension has not to be considered as an actor As Callon explains the diﬀerence is blurred and diﬀerentiating them has only practical incidence The set of threads and tendencies dimension poses Web 2 0 as more than a technical or practical phenomenon Indicators emphasize the impact of the previous dimension on a broader scale and refer to Web 2 0 explicitly as an object It is then characterized and qualiﬁed in such deﬁnitions The black box like approach invites me to suggest that the third dimension describes Web 2 0 as a set of eﬀects This proposition is supported by the fact that in order to cover those aspects and characteristics authors take most of the other dimensions for granted It is also when deﬁning the concept at that level of abstraction that the discussions are more challenging and sometimes divergent By the time the three dimensions may be considered as an element of the triptych I suggest that its structure from the ANT point of view may be applied too copying the links of the triptych to each dimension Note that contrary to the order I choose to change in the methodic presentation of dimensions in this analysis the initial order used by O Reilly has been restored as it ﬁt perfectly with the conceptualization proposed Figure 2 Web 2 0 concept applying links between

Web 2 0 this analysis Web 2 0 is a set of threads and tendencies initiated by a set of principles and practices that are mobilized through a set of tools oﬀers a framework to guide and structure consideration about Web 2 0 user generated content and related topics I think that not all the dimensions and the components of Web 2 0 always need to be addressed The extent to which it will be investigated depends on the ﬁeld the subject the research question the challenges methodologies etc nowadays most of the researchers are compelled to build their own framework model and deﬁnition Usually this is achieved by analytical literature reviews similar to this one I argue that by using the full model of web 2 0 see ﬁgure 4 any subject could be positioned in the framework The intended purpose of this approach is that the components and dimension involved can be easily highlighted and these that would not could be easily ignored Regarding the complexity of Web 2 0 phenomenon and the wide scope of potential ﬁelds to mobilize this seems to be quite useful to guide the literature exploration The need for theoretical references and the level of understanding authors models paradigms etc is not the same when a project deals with subjects such as Dynamic of UGC Case Study Lommel TV and Dealing with UGC Adjusting Information managers source selection and information quality assessment whereas they are a priori framed by the same changing context viii Once it is positioned within the framework a researcher enjoys an overview of the main elements involved in the subject thanks to the indicators This framework could also be used in mapping and positioning a set of research projects into a synthetic table Whatever the scale team department regional or international research community this proposition could contribute to understand the complex aggregate of research dealing with Web 2 0 and its impact on society Finally this framework is not accomplished and
