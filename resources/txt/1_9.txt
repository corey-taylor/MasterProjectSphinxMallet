Bowel Project Investigators from administration of tamoxifen its use as a breast cancer preventive agent is appropriate in many women at increased risk for the disease J Natl Cancer Inst 1998 90 1371 88 On June 1 1992 the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project NSABP implemented a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the worth of tamoxifen for the prevention of breast cancer in women considered to be at increased risk for the disease The term prevention as used in this article indicates a reduction in the incidence risk of invasive breast cancer over the period of the study Although tamoxifen prevented the appearance of a substantial number of breast cancers over the duration of this study the term prevention does not necessarily imply that the initiation of breast cancers has been prevented or that the tumors have been permanently eliminated The primary aim of the NSABP Breast Cancer Prevention Trial BCPT P 1 was to determine whether tamoxifen administered for at least 5 years prevented invasive breast cancer in women at increased risk Secondary aims were to determine whether tamoxifen administration would lower the incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions and reduce the incidence of bone fractures Additional objectives were to evaluate breast cancer mortality and tamoxifen s adverse effects in order to assess the benefits and risks from the drug and in keeping with recent advances to obtain information with regard to breast cancer genetics Tamoxifen was chosen as the agent to be evaluated because of its demonstrated benefit when used alone as well as in combination with chemotherapy to treat advanced breast cancer 1 5 and because of its proven efficacy in reducing tumor re Affiliations of authors B Fisher

Downloaded from http jnci oxfordjournals org at University of Florida on September 1 2010 Background The finding of a decrease in contralateral breast cancer incidence following tamoxifen administration for adjuvant therapy led to the concept that the drug might play a role in breast cancer prevention To test this hypothesis the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial P 1 in 1992 Methods Women N 13 388 at increased risk for breast cancer because they 1 were 60 years of age or older 2 were 35 59 years of age with a 5 year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1 66 or 3 had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to receive placebo n 6707 or 20 mg day tamoxifen n 6681 for 5 years Gail s algorithm based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors was used to estimate the probability risk of occurrence of breast cancer over time Results Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49 two sided P 00001 with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow up of 43 4 versus 22 0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups respectively The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger 44 50 59 years 51 and 60 years or older 55 risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ 56 or atypical hyperplasia 86 and in those with any category of predicted 5 year risk Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50 two sided P 002 Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor positive tumors by 69 but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor negative tumors was seen Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease however a reduction in hip radius Colles and spine fractures was observed The rate of endometrial cancer was increased in the tamoxifen group risk ratio 2 53 95 confidence interval 1 35 4 97 this increased risk occurred predominantly in women aged 50 years or older All endometrial cancers in the tamoxifen group were stage I localized disease no endometrial cancer deaths have occurred in this group No liver cancers or increase in colon rectal ovarian or other tumors was observed in the tamoxifen group The rates of stroke pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis were elevated in the tamoxifen group these events occurred more frequently in women aged 50 years or older Conclusions Tamoxifen decreases the incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer Despite side effects resulting METHODS Planning and Initiation of the Trial In June 1990 the National Cancer Institute NCI invited proposals from clinical cooperative groups for a feasibility pilot study that if approved would permit the design and conduct of a protocol for a breast cancer prevention trial These proposals were to be reviewed by the Cancer Control Protocol Review Committee in the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and Control by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program Review Committee by representatives of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and by other NCI National Institutes of Health staff In addition external peer review was to be conducted by an ad hoc Special Review Committee convened by the Division of Extramural Activities of the NCI In February 1991 the NCI and the National Cancer Advisory Board approved the application submitted by the NSABP on July 3 1991 the NSABP received approval from the Food and Drug Administration Investigators from 131 clinical centers throughout the United States and Canada see Appendix A were selected by a peer review process to be contributors to the trial All investigations conducted were approved by review boards at each institution and were in accord with an assurance filed with and approved by the U S Department of Health and Human Services Each of the 131 clinical centers had on site auditing to monitor and assess data quality Screening for breast cancer risk eligibility was initiated on April 22 1992 and randomization was begun on June 1 1992 During the first year of accrual i e from June 1 1992 through May 31 1993 nearly half 48 of the 16 000 women the number originally projected as being necessary to accomplish the study goal were accrued to the study During the last 7 months of 1993 and the first 3 months of 1994 nearly 3300 additional participants were enrolled Thus by the end of March 1994 approxi 1372 ARTICLES mately 11 100 women had either been randomly assigned or had agreed to participate in the study At that time accrual was interrupted and was not resumed until March 1995 Randomization was completed on September 30 1997 More detailed information regarding participant accrual has been published 29 Conditions for Participant Eligibility Women were deemed acceptable for the P 1 study if they met certain eligibility criteria defined in the protocol and were enrolled at one of the NSABP institutions that had been selected as contributors to the study To be eligible for the trial the participants had to have 1 signed a consent document that had been witnessed and dated before randomization 2 been either 60 years of age or older or between the ages of 35 and 59 years with a 5 year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1 66 or had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ LCIS 3 had a life expectancy of at least 10 years 4 had a breast examination that demonstrated no clinical evidence of cancer 5 had a mammogram within 180 days before randomization that showed no evidence of breast cancer 6 had normal white blood cell and platelet counts and normal hepatic and renal function tests 7 not been pregnant upon entry into the study or planned not to become pregnant while on protocol therapy 8 been accessible for follow up 9 undergone an endometrial sampling before randomization if they had a uterus and were randomly assigned after July 8 1994 Endometrial sampling upon study entry was optional for participants randomly assigned before that date 10 taken no estrogen or progesterone replacement therapy oral contraceptives or androgens for at least 3 months before randomization and 11 had no history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism Breast Cancer Risk Assessment The algorithm for estimating breast cancer risk was based on the work of Gail et al 30 who developed a multivariate logistic regression model in which combinations of risk factors were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of breast cancer over time The variables included in the model were age number of first degree relatives with breast cancer nulliparity or age at first live birth number of breast biopsies pathologic diagnosis of atypical hyperplasia and age at menarche In its original form the model predicted the combined risk of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers for white women Making appropriate modifications to account for a different attributable risk we applied the risk ratio RR for each of the parameters used in the Gail model to the expected rates of invasive breast cancer only Modifications to allow for race specific determinations of breast cancer risk were also incorporated into the model The 1984 1988 Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results SEER 1 rates of invasive breast cancer were used as the expected rates The total U S mortality rates for the year 1988 were used to adjust for the age specific competing risk of death from causes other than breast cancer Risk Benefit Each woman screened was provided with a risk profile that identified her breast cancer risk and displayed a plot of projected risk over her lifetime Fig 1 To enable the women to make a more informed decision about their participation in the trial each of them received information about the potential number of breast cancer and coronary artery cases that might be prevented from the use of tamoxifen as well as the number of cases of endometrial cancer and pulmonary embolism that might be caused by the drug Statistical Methods Randomization of participants in a double blind fashion was performed centrally by the NSABP Biostatistical Center and participants were stratified by age 35 49 years 50 59 years ജ60 years race black white other history of LCIS yes no and breast cancer RR 2 5 2 5 3 9 ജ4 0 To avoid imbalances in treatment assignment within a clinical center an adaptive randomization scheme using the biased coin method of Efron 31 was used The trial was monitored by an independent data monitoring committee known as the Endpoint Review Safety Monitoring and Advisory Committee ERSMAC which was composed of representatives with expertise in clinical trial methodology from a variety of disciplines including oncology gynecology cardiology biostatistics epidemiology and research ethics The design of the study included formal interim monitoring for early stopping based on the primary end point of the trial i e the incidence of invasive breast cancer The stopping rule of Fleming et al 32 was employed by the use of bounds that used less than 1 of alpha In addition as an informal tool to facilitate the monitoring Journal of the National Cancer Institute Vol 90 No 18 September 16 1998 Downloaded from http jnci oxfordjournals org at University of Florida on September 1 2010 currence and prolonging survival when administered as postoperative adjuvant therapy in stages I and II disease 6 10 Findings indicating that tamoxifen treated patients had a statistically significantly lower incidence of contralateral breast cancer 9 13 and that most patients used tamoxifen safely with good compliance and minimal side effects also provided justification for its evaluation as a preventive agent 14 Equally compelling was the extensive information related to the drug s pharmacokinetics metabolism and antitumor effects that had been observed in experimental animals and humans 15 18 In addition there was evidence to indicate that tamoxifen interfered with the initiation and promotion of tumors in experimental systems and inhibited the growth of malignant cells by a variety of mechanisms 19 21 Because tamoxifen had been shown to alter lipid and lipoprotein metabolism 22 26 which could reduce the risk of coronary artery disease it seemed appropriate that the incidence of and mortality from ischemic heart disease also be assessed In addition there was evidence to indicate that perhaps because of its estrogen agonist activity 27 28 tamoxifen might have a beneficial effect on osteoporosis Consequently the decision was made to determine whether tamoxifen reduced the incidence of bone fractures at selected sites By September 30 1997 13 388 women aged 35 years and older had been randomly assigned in the P 1 trial Because this number was considered adequate to meet the study objectives as they related to breast cancer participant entry was terminated On March 24 1998 an independent data monitoring committee which had provided oversight for the study since its inception determined that in accordance with prespecified rules for stopping the study the findings indicating a reduction in breast cancer risk were sufficiently strong to justify disclosure of the results This article is the first published report of the findings obtained from the P 1 study invasive breast cancer noninvasive breast cancer and invasive endometrial cancer were determined by use of the exact method assuming that the events came from a Poisson distribution and conditioning on the total number of events and the person years at risk 34 Under these conditions the expected proportion of events in the tamoxifen group p has a binomial distribution and was defined as the number of person years in the tamoxifen group PYtam divided by the total number of person years in both groups PYtam PYplac The observed proportion of events po was defined as the number of events in the tamoxifen group ntam divided by the total number of events in both groups ntam nplac The P value for testing a difference in the event rates between the groups was then computed as an exact binomial test of the hypothesis that p ס po Event rates in the two treatment groups were also compared by use of the RR and 95 confidence intervals CIs in which the rate in the tamoxifen group was contrasted with that in the placebo group CIs for RRs were also determined assuming that the events followed a Poisson distribution conditioning on the total number of events and person years at risk Under this circumstance the CI for an RR was determined by first finding the upper pU and lower pL limits of the CI for po where po ס RR PYtam RR PYtam PYplac and RR 1 ס Then the CI for the RR was determined by solving the equation RR ס p PYplac 1 p PYtam where pU and pL were substituted as the value of p respectively Cumulative incidence rates by follow up time were determined accounting for

by identifying and eliminating cancer causing agents and to secondary prevention which involved screening individuals at increased risk for cancer in the hope that early detection and treatment would affect survival it was not until the mid 1980s that serious attention was given to chemoprevention an approach aimed at reducing cancer risk by the administration of natural or synthetic clinical compounds that prevent reverse or suppress carcinogenesis in individuals at increased risk for the disease 38 Although biologic and clinical considerations related to chemoprevention have received much attention 39 41 almost no studies have been directed toward evaluating the concept as it relates to breast cancer Although information obtained in the l980s provided support for the theory that dietary fat might be associated with the occurrence of breast cancer and that restricting fat intake could perhaps reduce the incidence of the disease 42 a trial to test that hypothesis has only recently been implemented The use of retinoids for the prevention of breast cancer began to receive attention in 1987 when a study was initiated to evaluate the effectiveness of fenretinide 4 HPR 43 To date as far as we are aware no information with regard to breast cancer end points has been reported from that trial The findings in this article provide the first information from a randomized clinical trial to support the hypothesis that breast cancer can be prevented in a population of women at increased risk for the disease They show that tamoxifen administration reduced the risk of invasive and noninvasive breast cancers by almost 50 in all age groups Of particular importance is the finding that a benefit from tamoxifen was identified among women at various levels of risk within the spectrum of risks associated with participants in the P 1 study Because of the importance of knowing whether or not the finding that tamoxifen reduces the incidence of tumors can be generalized to all women extensive effort was directed toward recruiting nonwhite participants Despite great effort the number of nonwhite participants was small and there were few events among those women For these reasons the size of the treatment effect estimated from the total population 49 reduction of breast cancer risk may not be a reliable estimate for nonwhite women Also of importance are the findings obtained in women who had a history of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia pathologic entities thought to increase the risk of invasive breast cancer Although the present study was not designed to address these issues it provides the only quantitative information available from a clinical trial about the magnitude of the risk of invasive cancer in women with a reported history of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia Journal of the National Cancer Institute Vol 90 No 18 September 16 1998 Downloaded from http jnci oxfordjournals org at University of Florida on September 1 2010 Placebo n 8946 ס Symptom thyroid gland and kidney Fifteen deaths in the placebo group and 22 deaths in the tamoxifen group were from causes related to the vascular system Four women died of stroke in the tamoxifen group whereas three women died of stroke in the placebo group Two women in the tamoxifen group and none in the placebo group died of arterial disease other than stroke Three women in the tamoxifen group and none in the placebo group died as a result of pulmonary embolism employing the drug for the treatment of breast cancer was inconclusive The P 1 study findings that failed to demonstrate that tamoxifen reduced the risk of and mortality from ischemic heart disease differ from those obtained in the Stockholm 48 and the Scottish 49 studies in which it was reported that tamoxifen reduced cardiac morbidity in breast cancer patients These findings are similar however to those observed in the NSABP B 14 trial In that study 50 although there was a trend that suggested the possibility of such an effect statistically significant differences in cardiovascular mortality were not observed in tamoxifen treated patients Thus although tamoxifen can improve lipid profiles its effect on the reduction of cardiovascular disease in women taking the drug remains uncertain While the current findings suggest that tamoxifen does not play a role in preventing ischemic heart disease they do show that at least during the duration of the P 1 study the drug did not have a detrimental effect on the heart One of the original aims of the P 1 study was to determine whether tamoxifen reduced the risk of fractures of the hip radius Colles and spine The current findings indicating a 45 39 and 26 reduction in fractures at those sites cannot be viewed as inconsequential When considered in light of the estimate made in 1990 that 24 million American women suffer from osteoporosis that 1 3 million fractures per year occur secondary to that disease and that the estimate of the cost of treating such patients is 6 1 billion per year the prevention of fractures is important for women at increased risk for breast cancer who are also at risk for osteoporosis as they age 51 Because the findings with regard to fractures are based on a relatively small number of events definitive conclusions relative to the effect of tamoxifen on the rate of fractures must await additional information Whether the benefit achieved from tamoxifen in the P 1 study was due to the drug s interference with the initiation and promotion of tumors or to hindrance of the growth of occult tumors is unknown Because it is likely that a broad spectrum of molecular biologic and pathologic changes in breast tissue existed among participants at the time of their entry into the trial it might be assumed that both mechanisms were responsible for the finding Nonetheless the absence of specific information to resolve the issue does not detract from the evidence indicating that tamoxifen did in fact prevent the clinical expression of tumors i e the goal of primary disease prevention The length of tamoxifen administration is another concern It has been speculated that tamoxifen administration for only 5 years may merely delay tumor growth for a short time and that if the drug fails to affect the process of tumor initiation and promotion tumors will subsequently appear In view of the time required for a tumor to become clinically evident another concern that has been raised is that the administration of tamoxifen for only 5 years may be inadequate Information from NSABP B 14 which indicated that the benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen administered to women with stage I ER positive tumors remained through 10 years of follow up fails to support that concern 52 Since the findings in that study also demonstrated that more than 5 years of tamoxifen did not enhance the drug s effect in the P 1 study the drug was administered for only 5 years However additional studies with more prolonged tamoxifen administration and follow up time are necessary before a hypothetical issue such as this one can be resolved Journal of the National Cancer Institute Vol 90 No 18 September 16 1998 ARTICLES 1381 Downloaded from http jnci oxfordjournals org at University of Florida on September 1 2010 and presents the only information to demonstrate that tamoxifen can reduce the magnitude of that risk When compared with women who had no history of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia the finding of a 100 increase in the average annual rate of invasive cancer among women in the placebo group who had a history of LCIS and of a nearly 57 increase in this rate among women with a history of atypical hyperplasia clearly indicates that these pathologic entities are associated with a substantial increase in a woman s risk for invasive breast cancer Even more important is the finding that tamoxifen administration dramatically reduced the risk of invasive cancer in women with a history of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia Although the findings indicating the extent to which the invasive cancer risk was reduced are compelling the occurrence of a 50 reduction in the risk of noninvasive breast cancer is equally important for the following reasons The expanded use of mammography has resulted in the more frequent detection of DCIS In view of the cost involved and the effort required to diagnose these tumors and in light of the debate about both the initial and subsequent treatment of patients with DCIS and the putative relationship between DCIS and the subsequent occurrence of invasive breast cancer a reduction in the risk of DCIS must be viewed as an important finding since prevention of that disease would obviate the above considerations Moreover the reduction in the incidence of DCIS provokes consideration of the biologic significance of that finding Cells comprising most DCIS lesions have been demonstrated to be ER positive 44 45 Consequently if DCIS is indeed a precursor of invasive cancer at least some of the invasive tumors that were prevented by tamoxifen in the P 1 study could be the result of the elimination of occult DCIS by the drug In that regard the findings regarding the characteristics of the invasive breast cancers that occurred among the participants in the P 1 study are of importance When the findings from tumors that occurred in the two groups were compared it was observed that in the tamoxifen group there was a decreased rate of invasive cancers that were ER positive that were 2 0 cm or less in size or that were associated with negative lymph nodes These observations provide insight relative to the biologic nature of the tumors that were prevented These findings are consistent with the thesis that the benefit from tamoxifen results from its inhibition of the growth and progression of tumors that are ER positive i e those that are more likely to exhibit slower growth and less likely to be associated with axillary nodal involvement It is also of interest that LCIS and atypical hyperplasia are most often ER positive 46 47 and that there was a marked reduction in tumors that occurred in women with a history of those lesions In view of these findings a question to be answered relates to when cells in the biologic cascade of events leading from tumor initiation to the phenotypic expression of invasive tumors express their ER status and thus may be affected by tamoxifen Although the P 1 study was not designed to have the power to evaluate specifically the hypothesis that tamoxifen reduced the rate of heart disease a secondary goal was to obtain information regarding the incidence of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarctions When the study was being designed there was evidence that tamoxifen altered lipid and lipoprotein metabolism 22 26 However information about tamoxifen s effect on the cardiovascular system that had been obtained from clinical trials 1382 ARTICLES ment of cataracts among women who were cataract free at the time of randomization An increase in the rate of cataracts was found in the tamoxifen group We do not consider the ophthalmic toxicities from tamoxifen administration sufficiently great to warrant withholding the drug from women such as those who participated in the P 1 trial Finally as we 10 62 and others 63 64 have noted in previous investigations certain vascular related events reported in the P 1 study were more frequent in older women who received tamoxifen than in those who received placebo While there was an overall increase in the average annual rate of stroke in women 50 years of age or older uncertainty exists regarding the mechanism responsible for these results There is also uncertainty regarding the cause of death in women who had a pulmonary embolism Although three deaths were reported as being due to pulmonary embolism all were associated with comorbid conditions that could have accounted for those deaths On the basis of the P 1 findings and this commentary it is necessary to consider the question of who should receive tamoxifen to decrease their risk of breast cancer The findings in this article indicate that women 50 years of age or younger who would have been eligible for the P 1 study are candidates for the drug Similarly women with a history of LCIS or atypical hyperplasia and postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer who have had a hysterectomy should be considered eligible for tamoxifen Women who have a history of DCIS may also be appropriate candidates for tamoxifen Findings from other NSABP trials B 17 and B 24 have demonstrated that the risk for an invasive breast cancer in women with localized DCIS is at least as high if not higher than that for women with a history of LCIS In the current study women in the placebo group who had a history of LCIS had an annual rate per thousand for breast cancer of 12 98 The annual rate of invasive cancer among women who underwent lumpectomy for DCIS was 23 7 B 17 and among those treated with lumpectomy and radiation therapy it was 14 4 B24 In both of those studies the risk of developing an invasive cancer was considerable That risk could be substantially reduced by tamoxifen administration Another group of women who might also be candidates for tamoxifen are those at high risk for breast cancer because they carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 genetic mutations In the P 1 study blood that was obtained from participants for the conduct of future scientific investigations is now being used to determine how many of them had these mutations and whether tamoxifen decreased their breast cancer risk While that information is as yet unavailable offering women who carry these mutations the option of taking tamoxifen may be considered since doing so provides an alternative to bilateral mastectomy Many women 50 years of age or older who have stopped menstruating have not had a hysterectomy and have no history of LCIS DCIS or atypical hyperplasia may also be eligible for tamoxifen The decision relative to which of these women should or should not receive tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention is complex The primary determinant for making such a decision relates to each woman s projected risk for breast cancer The higher the risk the more likely that tamoxifen would confer a benefit Women whose breast cancer risk is sufficiently Journal of the

results relates to the timing of tamoxifen administration In women at sufficient risk for receiving the drug the issue of timing should not be considered critical On the other hand it is likely that the biologic changes that occurred in breast cells were present when participants who subsequently developed tumors were enrolled in the trial Consequently it is not unexpected that such tumors began to be diagnosed early in the follow up period Thus it does not seem justified to delay administration of the drug to women such as those in the P 1 study who were at increased risk for breast cancer It is appropriate to consider whether the benefit from tamoxifen in reducing the incidence of breast cancer is sufficiently great to justify its use as a chemopreventive agent despite the risk of undesirable side effects From the onset of the P 1 study there has been considerable emphasis on the adverse effects of tamoxifen particularly with regard to endometrial cancer and vascular related toxic effects which predominate in postmenopausal women Recent reviews and individual studies of the relationship between tamoxifen and endometrial cancer indicate that the concern with regard to the level of excess risk of endometrial cancer may have been exaggerated and that when endometrial cancers do occur in women who receive tamoxifen they have as favorable a prognosis as those in women who do not receive the drug or who receive estrogen replacement therapy 53 57 In the P 1 trial the average annual rate of invasive endometrial cancer in women 50 years of age or older who received tamoxifen was similar to what we had noted in the B 14 trial i e about 2 per 1000 women per year Of particular importance are the observations in this study that refute the claim that endometrial cancers occurring in tamoxifen treated women are more aggressive are less easily manageable and cause more deaths than endometrial cancers that occur in non tamoxifen treated women or in those who have received hormone replacement therapy 58 There is no evidence either from this study or from any other NSABP trial 59 60 to support those contentions To date all of the invasive endometrial cancers noted in the P 1 study in women who received tamoxifen were FIGO stage I i e localized tumors Thus our findings fail to show that such tumors carry an unfavorable prognosis Nonetheless because of the increased risk of endometrial cancer women receiving tamoxifen should have regular gynecologic examinations and should see their physicians if they experience abnormal vaginal bleeding Reports have appeared about the dangers of liver damage hepatoma colon cancer and retinal toxicity resulting from tamoxifen administration As the findings in this article and in reports from other NSABP studies attest such concerns have not been substantiated To date no primary liver cancers have been reported in the P 1 trial and no increase in the incidence of either colon or any other second cancer other than cancer of the uterus has been observed Also no differences in the self reporting of macular degeneration were observed 59 cases in the placebo group and 60 cases in the tamoxifen group Reports suggesting that tamoxifen administration might be associated with ocular changes led to the conduct of a Tamoxifen Ophthalmic Evaluation Study in NSABP B 14 A recent report 61 from that study indicated that no cases of vision threatening toxicity occurred among tamoxifen treated women although posterior subcapsular opacities were more frequently observed in that group In this article information is presented relative to the develop It is likely that the paucity of events in the European studies was due to the relatively small number of participants and to the fact that the risk of breast cancer occurring among women in these trials was lower than that among participants in the P 1 trial Because the criteria used for selecting participants in the Italian and the British studies were different from those used in the P 1 trial women in those studies had a different risk for breast cancer than did P 1 trial participants in that the expected proportion of ERnegative tumors could have been higher in them This difference is important because tamoxifen is unlikely to prevent the occurrence of ER negative tumors The true statistical power of a study to detect an effect of tamoxifen would be a function of the number of tumors that are ER positive rather than a function of the total number of breast cancer events Thus if the expected proportion of ER negative tumors is high then the ability to show an effect of tamoxifen would be substantially reduced since the statistical power that is based on the total number of events would be diminished The fewer the number of events the more likely it is that this reduction in statistical power is a critical factor affecting the ability to detect a difference between the study groups Noncompliance is another factor that affects the ability to detect differences since it will result in a decrease of the anticipated effect of a drug The rates of noncompliance were appreciable in the European trials With small numbers of participants and relatively small numbers of events as occurred in those trials a high level of noncompliance will result in a substantial reduction in the likelihood of identifying a treatment effect In the P 1 study a high rate of noncompliance was used for samplesize estimates 10 per year of follow up Thus the sample size was planned to be sufficiently large to preserve adequate power even in the presence of a high rate of noncompliance Perhaps the most important reason for the failure of the European studies to provide an adequate test of tamoxifen s effect could be due to the fact that 41 of the women in the British trial and 14 in the Italian study received hormone replacement therapy This introduced a potential confounding factor that could have interfered with testing of the hypothesis that gave rise to the conduct of both trials The use of hormone replacement therapy was considered to be a protocol violation in the P 1 trial Until a clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of using tamoxifen with hormone replacement therapy is conducted it is difficult to assess the relevance of findings from trials using that regimen The issue has been raised that the P 1 trial was stopped prematurely and that the findings were reported too early The trial was stopped only when the independent monitoring committee for that study ERSMAC on the basis of stopping rules established before the onset of the trial concluded that the primary study hypothesis had been confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt i e that tamoxifen decreased the incidence rate of invasive breast cancer P 00001 It was concluded that additional follow up would not have resulted in improved estimates of treatment effects that would have justified withholding from the participants on placebo the knowledge that tamoxifen was an effective prophylactic agent This allows those women on placebo to consider taking tamoxifen While additional studies are needed to address the issues that have arisen as a result of our findings we consider it highly inappropriate to not offer tamoxifen to women who are similar to those in the P 1 study and who may benefit from its use as a breast cancer preventive agent Journal of the National Cancer Institute Vol 90 No 18 September 16 1998 ARTICLES 1383 Downloaded from http jnci oxfordjournals org at University of Florida on September 1 2010 high to offset the potential detrimental effects of tamoxifen would be candidates for the drug However women whose breast cancer risk is not as high should evaluate their individual benefits and risks with their physicians in order to make an informed decision with regard to the use of tamoxifen One way in which the benefit from tamoxifen can be estimated is to subtract the overall number of unfavorable events from the overall number of cancers prevented Whether such a risk benefit analysis is appropriate in deciding if tamoxifen should be used in the prevention setting is questionable It seems inappropriate to view an endometrial cancer as being equivalent to a breast cancer since when endometrial cancers occur in women who receive tamoxifen they are most often curable by hysterectomy and the mortality rate is minimal Consequently in the P 1 study the breast cancers that would have occurred had tamoxifen not been used would have resulted in an estimated mortality rate that would likely have been higher than that observed from the undesirable effects of the drug Moreover the morbidity after hysterectomy would likely have been less than that resulting from the surgery radiation chemotherapy and tamoxifen used to treat the unprevented breast cancer Tools that can be used for determining a woman s breast cancer risk and the net effect from tamoxifen when used to prevent breast cancer are currently being developed As has been observed with the successive use of newer chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of breast cancer it is likely that new prevention agents will improve upon the benefits achieved with tamoxifen The new NSABP chemoprevention trial P 2 represents such an effort That trial will compare the toxicity risks and benefits of the selective ER modulator SERM raloxifene with those of tamoxifen Raloxifene which has been shown to prevent osteoporosis will be evaluated in postmenopausal women to determine its value in preventing breast cancer without increasing the risk of endometrial cancer 65 The uncertainty of the clinical application of the current findings is analogous to uncertainties related to the use of systemic adjuvant therapy for breast cancer With each demonstration of the worth of such therapy questions continue to arise as to who should receive the treatment i e who will benefit and who will not who will not need the therapy because they will never demonstrate a treatment failure how much of a benefit is worthwhile and whether or not the toxicity and mortality encountered justify its administration Despite these uncertainties the use of adjuvant therapy was considered to be a major advance in the treatment of early stage breast cancer The use of a chemopreventive agent denotes a similar advance in that it is being employed at an even earlier stage i e during the origin and development of a phenotypically expressed cancer before its diagnosis Before submission of this article for publication the results of two European studies were published 66 67 that failed to confirm the P 1 study findings None of the information presented in them alters our conclusion that tamoxifen significantly reduces the probability of breast cancer in women at increased risk for the disease The three studies are too dissimilar in design population enrolled and numerous other aspects to permit making valid comparisons among them For a variety of reasons it is unlikely that the European studies provided an adequate test of tamoxifen s effectiveness as a preventive agent There were relatively few breast cancer events 70 in the British trial and 49 in the Italian study as compared with 368 events in the P 1 study Appendix A Clinical centers participating Name of center 1384 ARTICLES Program coordinator A Desai N
