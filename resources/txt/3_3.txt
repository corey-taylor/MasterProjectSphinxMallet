Web 2 0 in China The collaborative development of specific norms for individual expression Séverine Arsène Ph D candidate Sciences Po Orange Labs Paris severine arsene orange ftgroup com severine arsene sciences po org Paper presented at Politics Web 2 0 An International Conference Royal Holloway London United Kingdom 18 04 2008 ABSTRACT Web 2 0 services such as video sharing or tagging are very popular among the 210 million Internet users in China They provide a new kind of platform for self expression content production and opinion exchange In China Internet users most frequently discuss their car flat salary or dog in other words their lifestyle and values This is related to the rise of an urban and connected middle class I argue that although these discussions are seldom of political nature they are leading people to develop new forms of expression and adopt shared discussion rules Rationality and tolerance are increasingly required whilst the large majority of discussions are still spoilt by personal and sometimes abusive attacks A fieldwork stay in Beijing in 2006 and 2007 saw a wide range of popular debates on morality issues corruption and other social scandals Between harsh nationalism and moral indignation self regulation and responsibility moderators as well as users are collectively elaborating formal and informal rules of politeness and setting new criteria of objectivity It can be argued that the Internet offers an unprecedented platform for this peer negotiation of common rules and values which is even more meaningful in China where top down decisionmaking is the norm Nevertheless it is still too early to call this phenomenon a real deliberation process The in depth interviews with Internet users that were carried out will help us understand how the users themselves perceive the characteristics of these blooming online discussions 1 March 2008 The world s eyes are focused on China while Tibetan riots break out in Lhasa Press agencies compete with different versions of the story and Youtube is blocked again In the context of a severe censorship thousands of Internet users express various kinds of reactions online most of which follow the official line sometimes with a virulent tone1 making it doubtful whether it is possible to merely discuss the Tibetan question in China2 Youtube is a symbol of free speech in the West because it is one avatar of what is worldwide called Web 2 03 The expression 2 0 refers to some collaborative aspects of the Internet such as photo sharing FlickR or content aggregation RSS feeds for example In recent years the most successful Internet services have promoted peer collaboration and have enabled users to upload and share their own contents This phenomenon has revolutionized among other things social networking Facebook entertainment peer to peer file sharing information management Wikipedia and in all probability political involvement all over the world Now citizens have platforms to meet with peers share information and opinions upload multimedia documents and gain autonomy in front of governments In theory at least the Internet is a powerful vector of the popular political participation that has progressively become the symbol of a democratic society for Western philosophers4 In fact years of development of the Internet in Western countries have proved that it offers a very diverse environment which far from fulfilling old democratic dreams leads to new questions on the issue of public discussion5 As Peter Dahlgren argues the Internet offers a myriad of communicative spaces that are both distinct and interlaced Considering such questions as digital divide commercialization and the fact that the users are still dependent on their socio cultural background these spaces are not always perfect for democratic purposes Are Internet users really better informed Do they act as knowledgeable consumers as responsible citizens or both Do they accept to be confronted to antagonistic opinions The 1 TAYLOR Sophie Chinese seethe on Web over rare riots in Tibet Reuters 15 03 2008 via http www washingtonpost com wp dyn content article 2008 03 15

démocratie laviedesidees fr 2008 2 development of the Internet forces researchers to explore old questions again with fresh eyes Quoting Habermas 6 concept of communicative action Dahlgren7 underlines the fact that deliberation has become the central point of the Western ideal of popular participation As an ideology it has even become a deliberative imperative 8 in other words deliberation has become the main foundation of political legitimacy in democratic regimes This makes questions about the role of the spectators their position towards critical reflection and public controversies crucial This ideal type may not exist anywhere on the global Internet9 but this description represents the values that are generally accepted in the West as the key point of democratic deliberation It serves as a reference point to question new communication tools like the Internet Researchers do not only focus on the existence of free speech but also on the values associated to it which influence the various modalities of the discussion In the classic book of Manin discussion is defined as a situation in which 1 at least one of the interlocutors tries to produce a change in the opinion of the other 2 by the means of impersonal propositions and it requires that each of the interlocutors uses the faculty that allows to detach oneself from the singular and the immediate to reach the general and the durable that is to say reason 10 According to this definition an exchange of arguments is possible only if the participants believe that they can convince each other and reciprocally be convinced by each other This means that they consider that they share some interests in common despite their respective social belongings it is also what Boltanski calls distanciation11 They need to accept contradiction and to be able to articulate arguments to make their point understood by the other participants 6 HABERMAS Jürgen Droit et démocratie Gallimard Paris 1997 7 DAHLGREN Peter L

Principes du gouvernement représentatif Calmann Lévy Paris 1995 p252 in translation 11 BOLTANSKI Luc La souffrance à distance Métailié Paris 1993 3 There are plenty of Web 2 0 applications in China and they are very successful among the 210 million Chinese Internet users There are around twenty millions of blogs12 the contents of which are aggregated in very dynamic portals new pop stars are discovered on the Web13 forums serve as tools of community building for people who have the same tastes Here again the Internet is usually perceived as the space where citizens can develop together an autonomous public opinion through collective deliberation It is often taken for granted that they will do so as soon as censorship softens14 whereas the Internet users habits of online shopping and their taste for entertainment suggest that few Internet users are keen to get involved in political debates Moreover the recent events in Tibet and the vehemence of online comments highlight the necessity to analyze online discussions carefully before drawing any conclusions More than ever it is necessary to assess the nature and qualities of the discussions that are held online the values of the actors the context in which discussions happen and the rules that organize them The theories of deliberation provide precise concepts definitions and descriptions of the democratic ideal in the West They are only helpful landmarks to observe discursive phenomena but it is important to narrow down the meaning of concepts in their local context and the significance they may have for the actors themselves in order to describe their position towards discussion in an appropriate way I argue that the conversations and debates that take place on the Chinese Web do not fit the theoretical model of deliberation if defined as a rationalized exchange of contradictory arguments between peers resulting in the elaboration of a public opinion15 Instead the collective definition of online rules and values both confirms the Internet as a legitimate platform for public expression and contributes to elaborate specific normative framework that 12 For example the world record of blog readership is

misunderstanding I do not assume the existence of such a deliberation on the Western Internet either 4 partly differs from the values adopted in Europe This is not a denial of the real revolution brought by the development of the Internet in China but rather a call for a more careful observation of the specific logics that drive people s involvement in this complex space I intend to approach this issue through the study of some Internet users perceptions of online conversations on IM e mail forums and blogs which are the spaces where most online social interactions happen They have been asked about their usage of these services their opinion on the rules of each kind of Internet service and the values that they find important to respect online Examples of transgressions of these rules of politeness were used to highlight the significance of each kind of norm and value in their vision Published contents of forums and blogs are taken into account and some are quoted as examples of the Internet landscape and atmosphere However a large part of the Internet users activity on the Internet is in fact not visible on the Web For instance it is impossible to reach the majority of Internet users who only read comments online and never publish their own points of view Discussions start with the decision to get involved or not so we can not settle for online contents but we should instead focus on the users themselves and their motivations Why do they take part in online conversations when where and how During a fieldwork in Beijing in 2006 2007 for a PhD research project fifty persons between 18 and 40 both men and women were interviewed they use the Internet for personal purposes at least one hour per day on average Their profiles are randomly diversified in terms of profession income living area in Beijing As the research focuses on Internet usage in the post reform generation I have chosen to interview mainly young adults between 20 and 30 That generation happens to be the main group of Internet users in the Chinese statistics as the emergence of the Internet phenomenon still concerns in majority the very specific category of urban young educated Chinese people16 Considering the huge differences between social categories in China especially between rural and urban China it is important to keep in mind that my observations are limited to some young urban professionals in Beijing This approach sheds light on passive users who are seldom observed in Internet inquiries The results are inevitably different from interviews of active users whose patterns of communication logically include more involvement into the public space By choosing the 16 www cnnic net cn or GUO Liang Surveying Internet usage and impact in twelve Chinese cities www markle org oct 2003 5 criteria of Internet usage only I hope that the sample is more representative of average users though any representativity is illusory in this kind of qualitative research One should not be surprised to find more political indifference in this sample than in some Internet forums and this angle will inevitably have consequences on the overall analysis of the dynamics of the Chinese Internet There is an impressive homogeneity in the answers of the interviewees especially in the answers about the values related to online speech Only a couple of interviewees have different points of view on this question As space is limited the sentences quoted in this article are mostly examples of this common voice except where explicitly stated A MESSY PLATFORM OF EXPRESSION Very yellow very violent During the fieldwork I was aware that political issues might be difficult to address with some interviewees They sometimes refrain themselves from talking politics with strangers but they also define political issues in a very narrow way They often consider politics as the restricted field of government organization leaders meetings and international relations for example As I did not particularly target this domain but wanted to explore the interviewees personal opinions about online discussions I opted to use the word social issues in the questions Social issues potentially cover parochial questions such as neighborhood disputes as well as large economic or social problems like education policy reform I thought that this was broad enough to let the interviewees react on topics that have some general dimensions without bothering them with so called sensitive topics Quite surprisingly the interviewees identify as social issues such cases as murders adultery all kinds of scandals involving some physical or moral violence Such a proliferation of sinister details and sexual scandals was unexpected but a significant number of the interviewees mentioned tabloid like cases first when asked for examples of recent social issues they had paid attention to like this young lady I read comments only if it really interests me if it particularly calls my attention like a few years ago in Harbin more than twenty kids were killed and I was very touched because I found that very sinister Then there were reports on it the police intervened actually this case was discussed for about a year If they had solved the problem quicker it would have been different but at that time there were lots of forums that talked about it and we expressed our opinion 6 Did many people express their opinion Yes a lot because it shocked everybody gongfen It was a Web café manager his girlfriend had gone and he went crazy so he took children to his place and cut their limbs Then one of them was cleverer he managed to escape and the case was published but by that time there were already twenty children dead at least 17 There are countless cases like this one on the Chinese Web and the interviewees are obviously very sensitive to them The violent nature of some parts of the Internet is largely denounced in the national media The Internet is described as a wild place where one can easily be confronted to pornography coarseness verbal and visual violence It is not a place for children because it is very yellow very violent 18 as a middle school student said last January when she was interviewed for a CCTV broadcast There is room for scandals on the Chinese Internet indeed Some are of moral nature dealing with cases of animal cruelty such as the famous story of a woman crushing the head of a baby cat with her high heels19 She became the victim of a real manhunt online and offline Other cases underline class struggle like the BMW case in which a massive quarrel happened after peasants damaged a luxurious car20 Of course the most violent reactions occur when patriotism is involved as witnessed in some anti Japan campaigns21 Any topic involving Japan on mainstream Web portals attracts violent comments and insults directed at Japanese pigs or worse In the same category the recent riots in Lhasa also witnessed a vitriolic outpouring of anger and nationalism directed against Tibetans and the West on the Chinese blogs22 17 XYH piano teacher 27 18 MARTINSEN Joel The yellow violent mob culture of a Chinese BBS

article 2008 03 15 AR2008031500633 html 7 The existence of a rather high level of violence online including rude vocabulary intolerant opinions and pornography is not a Chinese specificity The Internet is not easier to control than the average communication channels and it is host to a variety of extreme situations almost everywhere in the world In the Chinese context Internet users have specific reactions toward this phenomenon though and their own perceptions of the possibilities and limits of the Internet can give us some clues about their vision of the do s and don ts in Chinese society These frank expression patterns observed online were rather surprising because I thought that asking about social issues would call examples of debates or disputes that would be treated with argument exchanges In other words I had expected stories about controversies opposed opinions and values about the way to articulate one s own point of view to answer other people s statements and convince them These wrong expectations were probably the result of numerous readings on the Western model of deliberation Instead social issues inspired to the interviewees examples of scandals lynching popular indignation and the rules that are necessary to solve the online lack of civilization Obviously the role of online expression is perceived differently in China and in the West THE AMBIGUOUS FRAMEWORK FOR EXPRESSION Collective need for regulation As an example of the difficulty to find the right tone for discussions let us read a few sentences from a forum written right after a celebrity named Sun Haiying had declared that homosexuality is a crime Even though Sun Haiying s speech was a little exaggerated he is right to disapprove of the idea that one can be gay Homosexuals are unhealthy both psychologically and physically They would like to be accepted by the society which is understandable and deserves compassion But one can not throw torrents of insults at people who disapprove of homosexuality We must tolerate learn and understand more and we need less insults ignorance and attacks Opinions should not be so extreme and we need to keep respectful towards other people 23 23 translated from byron730319 http bbs news tom com i_741_83477 html in Chinese 15 08 2007 via http blogenchine com 2007 08 in French 8 The juxtaposition of a very radical opinion about homosexuality on the one side and the vocabulary about compassion understanding and tolerance on the other side is interesting Obviously it is difficult for that person to deal with his own feelings and express his opinions respectfully He acknowledges the necessity of being tolerant with each other whatever the intensity of the feelings and his own degree of disagreement for the sake of keeping the Internet peaceful The simultaneous presence of many people within a common space requires some selfregulation from each of the participants according to implicit rules that are progressively and collectively elaborated In other words the constraints of sustainability of the forums and blogs make a minimum level of tolerance compulsory Therefore the users are forced to learn the techniques of co existence to measure the subtle limits within which one does not harm each other s ego In that sense the Internet can be considered as a university for civic speech 24 The term civic is not really accurate but for now one can say that people are learning to be confronted to each other s opinions online This means that they need to decide whether they agree or not with what other people express on the Web and with the fact and manner of publishing it They must also decide what reaction to adopt and they need to learn moderation and politeness There are lots of choices They can ignore other people s opinions if they dislike them and visit other kinds of websites but they can not prevent the others from expressing themselves They can express their own agreement or disagreement with their own words and find the right balance between emotions and rationalization Otherwise they can also make their own comments about the very tone of the forum or other platform and give some advice to the other users about the right online behavior A rather unified normative lexical field emerges in the interviews One case after the other a whole framework of norms is established by trial and error The central values of this framework are moderation and responsibility which are the attributes of a certain kind of modernity or civilization People insult him with very dirty words they don t even look at the nature of this person you see The only impression people give me is to let go their violent anger they cannot really manage to discuss the case Why do I say that I don t have new friends on the Web it s because I believe that if you have emotions to let go it is not the right way to do it you need to be more civilized 24 LIAN Yue The Anonymous Internet is the Citizens University Southern Metropolis Daily 27 10 2006 9 So what should you do then You can express your own opinion on this topic but you should not attack the personality or the body of this person So people who post on these forums today are of a rather bad quality suzhi bijiao di 25 Personal attacks are one of the biggest concerns of the interviewees together with crude vocabulary It is notable here that H J criticizes the quality of the people who make personal attacks which is somewhat contradictory It is a common pattern that the interviewees classify people into good and bad and have the very behavior that they are criticizing that is to say attacking people instead of criticizing their ideas The most obvious particularity of the Internet as a publication space is that it is shared between lots of users who do not necessarily have the same opinions and behaviors According to the interviewees one should try not to have any influence on the others for fear of hurting them or creating a conflict There is no precise rule for example something one should express it according to one s most truthful opinion zui zhenshi de xiangfa treat this thing with the most correct attitude zhengque de taidu If this thing is not accurate it can be attacked with bad intentions One should treat this thing with moderation pinghe think over questions from this kind of correct attitude zhengque de taidu one should not be too violent Because when you publish it there is an influence on other people who read it for sure so if you speak up there you must be responsible fuzeren especially responsible towards society towards the Web you mustn t believe that there is no sense of reality on the Web that it s fake xujia The Web has two faces one is real and one is fake so when you discuss a question online it is the same serious things must be taken seriously renzhen 26 In this quite representative quote from a young mother truth moderation and responsibility are keywords as opposed to violence and falsehood Entering a public space like an Internet forum provides opportunities and also implies that one must act as an adult a responsible person who needs to pay attention to the others and to the society in general Notably her rather vague description of the society and the Web not only refers to other people and their feelings but also to the nature of the topic the kind of space and probably the level of surveillance in this space The Web is not only virtual One should be aware that the same rules apply online as offline and that speaking out online can have real consequences 25 H J salesman 28 26 G J 32 clerk in a car decorating company 10 Responsible in this case has a multiple meaning and refers to a vast quantity of codes that cover both expression forms and conversations contents Indeed the majority of Internet users agree that some things should not be mentioned online especially political contents They often remind it to each other and even exclude some participants from discussions when they have inappropriate opinions or behaviors One of the interviewees said that he had stopped publishing dissenting opinions when some other users started to insult him and said that he was a bad citizen This means that the collective rule setting which is supposed to play a regulation role and set the framework for peaceful collective exchanges is also likely to result in collectively censoring some people s opinions Only by watching the Web discussions Internet users can guess all or part of the informal rules that are elaborated and respected by the majority of other users Self regulation and censorship Social hierarchy Different discussion spaces have different codes and one should understand those codes before starting to participate actively It is sometimes difficult to master and it can lead some persons to feel ill at ease Many interviewees say that they lack self confidence when it comes to writing their opinions online For them it is important to have enough knowledge to master the language and to take time to organize arguments Unfortunately the fast rhythm of postings on some popular forum threads prevents them from achieving the required quality of expression so they just give up In fact these interviewees perceive the necessity of having certain particular skills to get legitimacy and be heard on the Web like what Gaxie calls competence 27 I don t like sending too much information in too public sites like discussions on forums Why On the one hand because I don t have time Because if it is public and you see an interesting comment it is often too late you need some time to write your 27 GAXIE Daniel Le cens caché inégalités culturelles et ségrégation politique Seuil Paris 1978 11 answer to think about it the topic has already passed and er It seems that generally speaking I don t have interesting comments to make But blogs or that kind of discussions you can talk you can take your time It s more interesting 28 Other platforms can provide better conditions for expressing views like smaller forums or blogs where the relationship between the main author and the visitors is more personal and the format of the comments is less interlaced That makes them feel more comfortable with opinion sharing but at the same time the mainstream platforms are progressively reserved for those who feel confident enough to express themselves This favors the emergence of educated people and experts as important figures on the Chinese Web When people enter the Web they are not totally anonymous and they need a certain status to be taken more seriously This is why some experts considered as more objective or impartial gain more authority in the public forums And one can read comments from different kinds of people among which experts members of a soccer team coaches Internet users And then for instance when I watch sports I pay attention to important meetings related news there are a lot The contents are far more numerous than those of traditional media 29 This extract shows that one does not write comments totally anonymously The status of the participants is important and other users pay attention to their opinions according to their level of recognition In that interviewee s mind one speaks as an expert or as a player and there is no neutral status in the exchange Because this sort of things does not relate to us our level of interest isn t high and if you haven t experienced it yourself when you express opinions on it you always bring a subjective bias After all if you re not an expert who has researched the topic it s not necessary to say anything about it So you think that only experts should publish their opinions At least it should be experts or people who have experienced it in person before who have really endured it personally 30 28 Z L marketing 25 29 Z L marketing 25 30 L G store manager 24 12 Interestingly this interviewee does not make any difference between witnesses and experts Both are presented as more objective than average people in the sense that they have more information on a case they understand better the protagonists motivations and interests In fact the word objective is almost an equivalent of close to the case in the mouth of L G whereas it would suppose taking distance in Western theory31 Consequently the very demand for objectivity is presented here as an obstacle to public participation Here speech can have a different value depending on the speaker s status though his or her authority can come from different sources One can put himself as a specialist or at least a privileged witness of some situation as someone who has experienced something interesting from a specific point of view be it as an actor or as a privileged observer Every writer and reader weighs other users ideas according to his or her own perception The conversation is not necessarily closed because of this selection but it can be organized subjectively arranged by the users instinctively and collectively so that some participants have more weight in the discussion and their ideas are put on top of the agenda The ambiguous role of moderators This collaborative process is done within the limits of the spaces written rules and under the guidance of the moderators who are responsible of the published contents in any case There is a real demand for regulation on the users side so moderators play a very important role on the forums just as they do in Western countries32 They can censor all kinds of excessive postings They can give more visibility to some comments that they find relevant by putting them at the top of the page They can also remind the users of the explicit and implicit rules of the space The moderators have the power to delete messages and they often do so This role is often described as crude censorship by Western Internet observers who tend to forget that this function is also crucial on the Western Web platforms Indeed the Chinese moderators role is quite ambiguous as they also do a necessary work to guarantee that the space stays peaceful and allows good exchanges 31 BOLTANSKI Luc La souffrance à distance Métailié Paris 1993 32 WOJCIK Stéphanie The Three key roles of moderator in municipal online forums paper presented at Politics Web 2 0 An international conference Royal Holloway University of London April 17 18 2008 13 About that I have set up my own forum before I mean my personal forum so I have some understandings of the backstage processes because I need to protect myself from being attacked There are some malicious comments and there are some people who maliciously leave messages on your forum and then they denounce you this situation happens very often So if you want to avoid this situation you have to talk to the managers of some other big forums like that discuss with them Of course we have some discussion topics that are quite specialized like how to avoid this situation how to find methods of control when I want to control something 33 Sometimes moderators also end up deleting opinions that are not in line with the national positions Understandably they do so to protect themselves and the sustainability of their forum even more than to annoy the author of the comment There is no better example than Japan on this point For example if you are interested in a news item you can click to read the article and that s all What if you don t agree with the comments If I don t agree if people think it s bad someone can suppress it If the people on this site are talking about something special like Japan you can say that Japan is bad on some points and if you think that s bad if you don t agree and you write the contrary they delete it immediately Why It is the manager The manager Every website that has a comment page has a manager the manager s task is to clear up the garbage the rubbish comments 34 This obvious censorship must not lead us to condemn Internet regulation as a whole It is demanded and justified by the users themselves because it also protects them from some virtual conflicts and it promotes a politically and socially secure atmosphere for them to participate Thanks to the filtering process they feel that whatever they write it will be published only if it is checked and positively appreciated by the moderator Paradoxically limited as it is the framework of the Internet still offers an important platform for expression This is already a huge step in the Chinese context where expression has long 33 C L designer 26 34 F RT student 21 14 been a monopoly of the Chinese Communist Party CCP Publication which has long been the privilege of propaganda is being vested by individuals The resulting profusion of contents among which some are poorly civilized creates new kinds of anxieties for Internet users therefore they are contributing to the elaboration of a framework of formal and informal rules The users are learning how to behave in this sphere how to co exist with each other without shocking each other or feel shocked by the others In that sense the Internet in China offers some space for a constantly evolving user based construction of a set of rules that is negotiated obeyed and checked by the users themselves In doing so they are promoting such values as politeness objectivity moderation that seem to echo the Western discursive tradition This should not lead one to conclude to the advent of deliberation as a whole but only that of some aspects of it These aspects have a specific significance in the Chinese context and deserve to be explored more precisely Indeed many of these rules have origins in the Chinese political practices and take into account the constraints of the regime so the users are not elaborating a totally autonomous sphere and the collaborative dimension of rule setting is very ambiguous It both enables Internet users to validate a framework of discursive values that they find appropriate and contributes to maintain a kind of collective surveillance or even censorship Obviously the collective implementing of formal and informal rules is not necessarily the proof of the emancipation of Internet users towards the State True this framework is limited but it has not held back many Internet users from publishing contents on the Web to defend their country against the alleged Western conspiracy during the Tibetan crisis in March 2008 though Still the tone of the comments often crosses the most basic lines of politeness35 which leads us to wonder once again is discussion possible 36 and more precisely what discussion is possible 35 See this video that aims at proving the inalienable Chinese identity of Tibet The comments in English are addressed to Westerners and half of the sentences contain the word f On that topic contributions in Chinese are more or less on the same model http www youtube com watch v oWBAPAn5Ffo feature related 36 MCKINNON Rebecca Tibet Is discussion possible op cit 15 CONDITIONS FOR A LEGITIMATE ONLINE EXPRESSION In her analysis of psychological hotlines in the new consumer urban China Kathleen Erwin37 uses a foucaldian approach to analyze the reaffirmation of some social norms or constraints through these new forms of expression platforms in the 1990 s She remarked that most calls to the hotlines were formulated as complaints again family or marital pressure which in itself is the proof of a deep change in the mentalities but they usually ended up as a reaffirmation of the legitimacy of certain traditional practices In that case the opening of a channel for voicing complaints lead to the reconfiguration of power relationships instead of the mere liberation of citizens Likewise the values enhanced in online discussions in China enlighten Internet users position towards the function of public expression The very fact that one can discuss the rules and assess the existence of some censorship proves that the Internet is already taken for granted as a popular expression platform All the normative vocabulary used by the Internet users to qualify the legitimate online behavior can be analyzed as the manifestation of the role they attribute to this platform of expression which considerably differ from the model of deliberation Assertion of individual expression The excesses allowed by anonymity are not always disapproved of According to several interviewees almost everyone needs some space to relax from a stressful daily life and very few spaces allow the people to express their feelings so Internet violence is just natural and even necessary Most of the interviewees believe that the Internet is the right place for bursting out with anger frustration excitement and all kinds of extreme emotions that can not be expressed openly elsewhere An above quoted young lady expresses that indignation gongfen 38 is her main motive for participation on the Chinese Web She only posts comments online when she is strongly shocked by a news item and she usually posts very 37 ERWIN Kathleen Hear to heart phone to phone family values sexuality and the politics of Shanghai s advice hotlines in DAVIS Deborah dir The consumer revolution in urban China Berkeley California University Press 2000 pp 147s 38 X YH piano teacher 27 quotation p 5 16 short emotional reactions like this is shocking or Yes Another interviewee has the same feeling Most people want to relieve themselves from what dissatisfies them in the society or what dissatisfies them in other things Most of them just want to let off steam faxie 39 All in all it seems that the Internet has immediately been adopted by its users as a good space for popular expression and they find that it is worth coping with the drawbacks so that the population can use this opportunity for expression Here is one typical example of the conclusion which almost all the interviewees draw about the role of the Internet What can the Internet bring to China It can accelerate society s progress and technological development But I think that it is also a platform for everyone to exchange it is a place to express their own points of view In fact I think it s quite good 40 Some avatars of Internet violence can reveal a form of mobilization For example a specific category of young Internet users is called angry young feng qing because of their excessive positions online41 Some describe them as disrespectful and violent whereas others say that these young are just desperately trying to express their critical vision of the current society that is becoming too competitive and amoral Many scandals that cause widespread impulsive reactions undoubtedly reveal great popular concern for such questions as safety42 equity value of human life class struggle or national pride and they can be analysed as the affirmation of these new social norms43 but I do not want to develop this aspect here Instead I want to concentrate on the very modalities of the debates and on Internet users perception of the online exchanges of opinions and the rules that organize them 39 C H designer 26 40 X YH

scandales grandes causes Stock Paris 2007 17 The anger of these youth challenges the tolerance of other Internet users and it reveals the limits of online expression in their mind Freedom of speech is acknowledged under conditions Debate and polemic First of all according to most of the interviewees freedom of speech supposes that one should not contradict each other s opinion So I think that other people have their opinion and I have mine and it is not worth struggling about it when you have seen it it s over It is useless to start analyzing if things should be like this or like that everyone is free right So we can watch a little but when it s over I m not the kind of guy that makes comments or judges the quality 44 H J does not like to contradict other Internet users because he feels that it would result in refusing their own freedom Moreover he feels that contradicting someone on the Internet equals to judging the quality of the person and his or her speech As a result the very respect of other people of free online expression and the principle of tolerance lead this person to refuse contradictory debates and to choose the exit option Having opposed points of view highlighting the opposition and exchanging arguments is often perceived as attacking other Internet users It is seen as something uselessly aggressive when one should just ignore the opinions of the others and leave them alone Of course one can not underestimate the role of censorship in the defiance towards debate Having a different opinion is taking a risk at some point The interviewees express the necessity to be careful and speak in the terms allowed by the authorities that is to say in accordance with the tone of official media like the People s Daily It is necessary to play the melody of harmony For sure you must not speak about the leaders of the country you can not say anything about national leaders and in your dissertation you shouldn t mention things about the country s leaders I think that in China it s impossible every point that you want to criticize when you are in China you can not say it It is not like abroad if you want to go against the tide it is not possible It s like you you re writing a dissertation you must follow the tone write articles in accordance with the theme you must not leave the theme China is trying to reach the harmonious 44 H J salesman 28 18 society you must be careful to know if this is the harmony of the Internet the harmony of China you must write with the colours of harmony this is Chinese culture you can not change it everybody is like that 45 Chinese culture serves as a justification for what is first something forbidden by the communist system and censored by the authorities It is far easier for Internet users to publish conformist opinions than to test original ideas otherwise they would take the risk to sing another tune The musical metaphor is obviously an attempt to make the limits of expression look natural They are part of Chinese culture and they are not questionable in the eyes of the interviewee This effort to legitimize the situation reflects the personal appropriation of the national rules by this user It also reflects his position towards the foreign interviewer in front of whom it is important not to criticize the system Once again this supports the idea that unanimity definitely looks better than discord especially on a space that serves as China s showcase in front of the rest of the world Internet is not considered here as a place for public discussion but as a tool for displaying the most modern image of the country46 In that context being exposed to diverse opinions most often lead the interviewees to avoid getting involved into a debate Arguing with people who belong to other groups and who do not have the same point of view is most often perceived as a bad behavior The interviewees were often asked what their reaction would be if they came across an opinion on the Web with which they did not agree at all Their answers almost invariably contained pejorative vocabulary like polemic argue quarrel that were not inferred by the tone of the question By contrast the meaning of tolerance becomes slightly different from what it would be in another context It is more than an attitude of respect towards other people s opinions It implies not to contradict their opinions and to stay indifferent to them It is thus associated to a list of other values some of which are picked in the Chinese philosophy 45 M N chef 26 46 The Internet plays dozens of interlaced paradoxical and complementary functions We do not mean that the Internet is only a showcase but that when asked about the specific question of disagreement the interviewees tend to privilege this aspect 19 Zhongyong happy medium means something like letting go not doing polemic it sounds a little like that it sounds a little like Buddhist or Christian thinking it means that I am not going to quarrel with you about issues like power or money even if I must have desires but my behavior or my character will not be like that 47 For P Y the Chinese way of proceeding in discussions is the most subtle and it is more efficient to manage relationships Let us read further his interview One must have an amenable behavior suihe like this it facilitates relationships it is easier to cooperate gongshi in fact I think that it is easier to succeed in all domains In China we often come upon that sort of situations for example you don t agree with someone with your boss or you don t agree with your client if you quarrel violently even if you re right maybe he won t agree It is different abroad if you have an opinion you can say it directly you can tell everybody we need to do like this and then they do like this but not in China We speak in a more subtle way weiwan we express our point of view in a more subtle way if it s my colleague or if it s my friend I must use this sentence we think more about how to say things to settle issues You can not expect from the Chinese to settle issues the same way as Westerners do it would confuse things If I start to argue violently on some questions with people I don t believe that after that we could still solve issues together and in peace So I think that it is understandable that when I read on the Internet that the Chinese should take inspiration from Western thinking I don t agree We need to learn some things but on other things we need to respect ourselves the context is different 48 It seems that it is impossible to solve a disagreement in the eyes of P Y Discussion neither has the power to settle questions nor to overcome them it can only underline discord and make it even more insuperable The reference to a commercial situation implies that the reference to tradition is mainly used for strategic purposes Indeed the strategic context is the ultimate reference to decide what elements can be kept or not within the various elements of the Chinese traditions Chinese Internet users mobilize various justifications for feeling uncomfortable with debate Whatever the justifications the function of online expression is obviously not to exchange arguments and convince each other It is a space available to put one s testimony record one s diary drop off some emotions separately from the other users In this context what dialogue is possible between the different Internet users 47 P Y manager in a medicine company 25 48 P Y manager in a medicine company 25 20 Diversity pluralism and public opinion In an article about a French radio broadcast in which telephone operators had to select listeners for speaking on air Dominique Cardon49 studies into details the sometimes arbitrary criteria that determine the legitimate participation in that kind of public space Apart from the basic requirements of politeness and level of language the persons in charge of the selection privileged listeners who were able to highlight a certain level of general interest through their personal testimony They needed to find the general dimension that can have an interest for the whole society in their particular situation Under that condition they could be selected to participate in the radio broadcast In my Chinese sample this detachment pattern is almost never referred to and even sometimes criticized The role of experts and witnesses has been mentioned before Moreover one belongs to a group and he is representative of that group be it regional professional national by income or else Paradoxically social belongings are taken for granted by the interviewees and they do not consider the idea that each individual s various belongings sexual educational professional and so on could be contradictory When they describe their social belongings the interviewees portrait a highly stereotyped and segmented society For example M N tells us that the population s mentality depends on the geographic origins of the people One of the pleasures derived from the Internet is to compare the habits of the North and the South which incites people from each region to play the assigned roles There can be topics like this there are Beijingers and Shanghainese Beijingers can represent typical Northern people and Shanghai represents a typical city of the South and people from these two cities compare their characters 50 This interviewee was quite enthusiastic about this experience For him it represented the pleasure of sharing a common space and enjoying co presence on a same virtual platform Indeed such a comparison encourages tolerance and diversity but in this kind of conversations you can only speak for yourself and never be representative of the others There is no common point between people from different social categories therefore they can 49 CARDON Dominique Comment se faire entendre La prise de parole publique des auditeurs de RTL Politix vol 8 n 31 1995 pp 145 186 50 M N chef 26 21 not speak for one another let alone criticize one another s opinion Apparently different people s interests are necessarily antagonistic I think perhaps some people can represent an association that is to say he can represent a fixed crowd for instance a profession perhaps some people can represent the workers some people can represent the farmers some people can represent the white collar workers but the person who speaks on behalf of the white collar workers benefits definitely cannot represent the lowest level social citizens this is certain then let s say the lowest level of the society definitely cannot represent such a high level social stratum as white collar workers they definitely cannot represent each other 51 Given that everyone has different points of view on each problem and that everybody has his own life style different educational levels we don t understand things the same way so it is difficult to say that we are going to make comments maybe sometimes you find something is wrong it is not correct and someone else finds it s right everything is possible I think that everything has two faces there can not be only one opinion on something 52 In this vision every citizen s opinion can only be considered as corporatist selfish and partial Every category is seen as having contradictory points of view and the multiple faces of the individuals that result from their personal backgrounds are neglected It seems difficult to imagine that these people could find a common position together The tolerance that is valued in this model is that of diversity not that of pluralism In the ideal type of pluralism several points of view can emerge in one single group and be shared in order to be discussed There is a natural paradox in the concept of pluralism There must be a basic agreement between everyone on the very fact that disagreement is possible and even fruitful53 On the contrary in the model of a segmented and stereotyped society the diversity of opinions can only be the result of diverse social situations Consequently they are not arguable and relativism is the only possibility to deal with divergent opinions Given this description of the society a public opinion that would be the result of exchanges of views between the different social categories seems unlikely to emerge The word public opinion is used by the interviewees though with a quite unexpected definition and it reflects their perception of a segmented society 51 C H designer 26 52 X YH piano teacher 27 53 LECA Jean La démocratie à l épreuve des pluralismes RFSP Vol 46 n 2 1996 pp 225 279 22 In Harbin it was also in the North East there was a nurse in Harbin who crushed the head of a kitty with her high heels we call that the cat case When it broke out when the photo was published it was already on TV people found where she worked they called the hospital her home they prevented her from living normally that s how it happened After that the hospital fired her they had to otherwise it was impossible to work normally this is the pressure of public opinion 54 Here public opinion is not the result of a diversity of opinions nor that of a debate Instead the Internet users are unanimous and they collectively condemn the actions of the woman There is no collective exchange of opinions nor any organized reaction but only a massive arbitrary and excessive personal harassment that resulted in the punishment of one particular person and her entourage The general dimension of public opinion is replaced by a singular example which has almost no impact for the rest of the society Public opinion represents here a large number of people who have the same opinion and who have always had that opinion even without exchanging with one another whatsoever In other terms this kind of massive mobilization results in the enforcement of shared moral norms rather than the elaboration of a public opinion conceived as the result of public discussion and opposed to a simple aggregation of multiple individual opinions The result of this is a phenomenon of polarization of the opinions on the different discussion spaces Polarization Many people pour out their feelings in a not reasonable way you see They can dirty this platform In fact there are people like that in every country who don t understand anything they only want to let off steam faxie or put anything on the Web This can make it really dirty and people who used to speak in a rather civilized manner end up going away from this platform 55 Heterodox opinions do not disappear in that kind of situation People who express discordant opinions can be excluded from some Internet platforms like mainstream portals Sina or Sohu for instance but they can still find spaces to publish their own opinions The result is the marginalization of heterodox opinions not their disappearance 54 L JJ tourism 23 55 H J salesman 28 23 The freest are blogs because they are not controlled And on QQ too there is a blog space On MSN too Until now you don t need to give much information to open your own blog If the moderator sees that there is a problem he can intervene he can tell you but in general they don t have the means to control you Even freer than that you have MSN or QQ But the drawback is that there is no set address that is always there Everything you say disappears immediately It is like a telephone you can talk without thinking So finally you think that blogs are the most interesting Yes because first if you want to have freedom of speech it needs to be open because if it is not open you can not say it is free 56 Here the interviewee who is someone particularly critical and mobilized underlines the importance of publicity When large audience forums become uncomfortable for having debates Internet users can open their own blog or their own small forum thread in which they will probably be more at ease to express their personal opinions These smaller spaces can be considered as more personal or private by the writers as well as the readers They are a kind of hybrid space that allows some opinion exchanges They have some publicity anyway because information can spread very rapidly among millions of people through personal networks But they do not have the status of official news information is not openly debated among peers This does definitely not fit the ideal type of deliberation but some ideas are still exchanged and that they can spread very quickly without necessarily being discussed online Some hypotheses On the one hand the marginalization of minority opinions implies that there is little space for debate on the Chinese Web On the other hand one needs to take into account the niche spaces where some opinions are still offered to small publics that are more likely to reach the agreement of their readers than that of the public of bigger and more censored Web portals It would be interesting to explore further theories of the diffusion of opinions in this context of a fluid circulation of ideas that can be diverse but rarely publicly challenged The long tail theory57 could be useful to understand the circulation of ideas within the different groups of Chinese Internet users for example Elaborated in response to the development of Web 2 0 56 C H designer 26 57 for a short presentation see http en wikipedia org wiki The_Long_Tail 24 services this theory makes the hypothesis that Internet platforms provide space for the creation of a multitude of tiny audiences which at the end could represent a powerful audience if considered altogether In that sense Web 2 0 theories are stimulating because they propose alternative models of opinion building that try to fit the fluidity of the exchanges of ideas on the Internet Expression on the Chinese Internet is not separated from social constraints It is inextricably embedded in Chinese society Nevertheless the rules are debated commented on reappropriated by the users They can select practical values within a repertoire offered by traditions by the economic context by international values etc This very appropriation process reveals that Internet users are coming to grips with public expression platforms The values defended by the Chinese Internet users like diversity tolerance and free opinion have specific meanings in their minds and they must be understood in the light of the local context Now popular expression is legitimate within some limits that constantly evolve even though it is most often devoted to testimonies and anonymous psychological release For lots of Internet users online expression is more an individual opportunity to release emotions than a collective tool to debate divergent opinions 25 REFERENCES BLONDIAUX Loïc et SINTOMER Yves L impératif délibératif
