Pentagon chiefs Robert M Gates and Leon E Panetta were critical of Mr Obama for asking Congress to authorize the use of force against Syria in retaliation over its use of chemical weapons But they disagreed on whether military action would be an effective response Mr Gates said Mr Obama s proposed military strike was a mistake while Mr Panetta said it was a mistake not to carry out an attack My bottom line is that I believe that to blow a bunch of stuff up over a couple days to underscore or validate a point or a principle is not a strategy Mr Gates said during a forum at Southern Methodist University If we launch a military attack in the eyes of a lot of people we become the villain instead of Assad he added referring to President Bashar al Assad of Syria Mr Gates the only cabinet member from the administration of George W Bush whom Mr Obama asked to stay said missile strikes on Syria would be throwing gasoline on a very complex fire in the Middle East Haven t Iraq Afghanistan and Libya taught us something about the unintended consequences of military action once it s launched Mr Gates said Mr Panetta also speaking at the forum said the president should have kept his word after he had pledged action if Syria used chemical weapons When the president of the United States draws a red line the credibility of this country is dependent on him backing up his word Mr Panetta said Once the president came to that conclusion then he should have directed limited action going after Assad to make very clear to the world that when we draw a line and we give our word then we back it up Mr Panetta said Mr Gates and Mr Panetta made their most extensive comments on current national security policy and certainly their most critical statements on policies of the administration they both served since leaving public service Both former secretaries have announced plans to publish memoirs expected to shine more light on the internal policy debates of their tenures Neither expressed a specific reason for breaking their silence on the Obama administration s decisions Tuesday night Asked about the comments at a news conference on Wednesday the current defense secretary Chuck Hagel said he had the greatest respect for his two predecessors but added Obviously I don t agree with their perspectives Another former high ranking Obama administration official Michael J Morell who recently retired as the deputy director of the C I A also expressed skepticism about the negotiations brokered by Russia I think this is the Syrians playing for time Mr Morell told Foreign Policy magazine in an interview published Tuesday on its Web site I do not believe that they would seriously consider giving up their chemical weapons Mr Gates said he doubted whether President Vladimir V Putin of Russia was sincere in his efforts to broker a deal and said he was skeptical that the Syrian government would disarm He said it was absurd that Syria needed days or weeks to identify the location and size of its chemical weapons arsenal and he suggested that the timetable should be an ultimatum of 48 hours When asked whether the West should trust Mr Putin Mr Gates said Are you kidding me He advocated identifying credible partners within the Syrian opposition and increasing support including weapons but not surface to air missiles which could be seized by militants for terrorist acts against civilian aviation He also supported a strategy of sanctions that labeled members of the Assad government as war criminals with the threat of arrest if they left Syria and suggested sanctions on Assad family members living or studying overseas including on their financial holdings Such pressure might prompt some in the inner circle to negotiate an end to the civil war Mr Gates said Although Mr Gates said that any unilateral military action against Syria would be a mistake he also said it was unwise for the president to have sought Congressional authorization to use force because of the risk to presidential prestige if he was rebuffed If Congress voted no it would weaken him Mr Gates said It would weaken our country It would weaken us in the eyes of our allies as well as our adversaries around the world Under questioning from the moderator David Gergen who advised four presidents and is now on the faculty at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard both former secretaries said that American credibility on Syria was essential to enduring efforts to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons Iran is paying very close attention to what we re doing Mr Panetta said There s no question in my mind they re looking at the situation and what they are seeing right now is an element of weakness Mr Panetta said that the president has to retain the responsibility and the authority on this issue and that it was wrong to subcontract the decision to Congress Mr President this Congress has a hard time agreeing as to what the time of day is he said
