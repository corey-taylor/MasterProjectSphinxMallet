and Academic Surgery Division Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Adelaide South Australia Australia n Abstract Based on the National Breast Cancer Audit of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons an association between patient age and type of breast cancer surgery received has already been demonstrated The aim of this study is to assess the patterns of surgical treatment for women with early breast cancer in relation to socioeconomic and insurance status Data on patient demographics diagnostic and surgical procedures and cancer characteristics in 115 872 episodes of early breast cancer reported to the National Breast Cancer Audit between 1998 and 2012 is used for this study Tumor size histologic grade number of tumors lymph node positivity and lymphovascular invasion are the major prognostic factors adjusted for Reconstruction following mastectomy is the most likely surgical procedure for the higher socioeconomic and privately insured patients Mastectomy alone is the most likely surgical procedure for the lower socioeconomic and for public patients No surgery is the most likely surgical outcome for the lower socioeconomic and the least likely for the higher socioeconomic population Open biopsy is the most likely diagnostic procedure for the lower socioeconomic and ﬁne needle aspiration for the higher socioeconomic population Socioeconomic and insurance status are both independently associated with the types of treatment and diagnostic procedure for women with breast cancer Opportunities present to investigate an association of these factors with morbidity and survival outcomes n Key Words breast cancer insurance socioeconomic status surgery B ased on the National Breast Cancer Audit NBCA of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons RACS an

effects of socioeconomic status and access to private health care on surgical patterns of care in people with colorectal cancer To our best knowledge there are however no studies that speciﬁcally evaluate such factors in addition to age for the Australian female population with breast cancer This study aims to assess the patterns of surgical treatment for women with early breast cancer in relation to socioeconomic and insurance status MATERIALS AND METHODS Data for this study was obtained from the NBCA This is a clinical audit that contains data on patients with breast cancer collected by surgeons throughout Australia and New Zealand with the aim of improving quality of care 1 Data on Australian patient demographics diagnostic and surgical procedures and cancer characteristics in

cancer is deﬁned as invasive tumors of not more than 5 cm in diameter with either impalpable or palpable but not ﬁxed lymph nodes and with no evidence of metastases This corresponds to tumors that are classiﬁed as T1 2 N0 1 and M0 1 Socioeconomic status quintiles 1 5 and insurance private public are the two main category groups analysed with respect to surgical treatment breast conserving surgery BCS mastectomy reconstruction following mastectomy no surgery and diagnostic procedure ﬁne needle aspiration FNA core biopsy open biopsy received Socioeconomic status is divided into quintiles with a lower number reﬂecting a lower status The following are the major prognostic factors accounted for in the analysis tumor size 1 10 11 20 21 30 31 40 and 41 50 mm histologic grade I II and III number of tumors one two and multicentric lymph node status positive negative and lymphovascular invasion absent and present The concept of socioeconomic status is based on the Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas SEIFA produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ABS The SEIFA index of relative disadvantage uses a number of variables such as income education and unemployment to quantify quintiles representing the areas of greatest relative disadvantage 6 In this study the most disadvantaged socioeconomic group SEIFA 1 is referred to as the lower socioeconomic population Figure 1 Socioeconomic status and diagnostic procedure p 0 001 and the least disadvantaged socioeconomic group SEIFA 5 is referred to as the higher socioeconomic population Chi squared testing was used to analyse the relationships between the two category groups socioeconomic status and insurance and the diagnostic and surgical treatment A p 0 001 was used for statistical signiﬁcance Generalized ordinal logistic regression was used to further illustrate the effect of socioeconomic status and insurance on the diagnostic procedure RESULTS Socioeconomic Status and Diagnostic Procedure Of a total of 11 179 patients with early breast cancer each quintile in this group falls within a range of 18 23 Fig 1 The most likely diagnostic procedure for the lower socioeconomic population is open biopsy and for the higher socioeconomic population is FNA The generalized ordinal logistic regression in Table 1 demonstrates further that the lower socioeconomic population is more than twice as likely to be part of the open biopsy group as opposed to FNA core biopsy when compared to the higher socioeconomic population Socioeconomic Status and Surgical Procedure The most likely surgical procedure for the higher socioeconomic population is reconstruction following Social and Insurance Effect on Breast Cancer 3 Table 1 Generalized Ordinal Logistic Regression for Likelihood of Open Biopsy OR SEIFA 5 SEIFA 4

make up 49 5 of a total of 25 025 patients analysed Fig 3 Public patients make up 42 7 with the rest being unknown When comparing a private to a public patient there is no particular trend in the type of diagnostic procedure received Core biopsy is the most likely procedure among public patients and the least likely among private patients In the generalized ordinal logistic regression Table 1 a public patient is less likely to be part of the open biopsy group as opposed to FNA core biopsy when compared with a private patient Insurance Status and Surgical Procedure No surgery is the most likely surgical outcome for public patients and the least likely for private patients Fig 4 If they do have surgery mastectomy alone is the most likely procedure for public patients as opposed to reconstructive breast surgery for private patients DISCUSSION This study demonstrates differences in both the diagnostic procedure as well as the surgical treatment received between the two demographic category groups that encompass socioeconomic status and insurance This is on a background of age already known to be independently associated with the surgical treatment for women with breast cancer with cancer pathologic characteristics adjusted for Since the beginning of the NBCA data set in 1998 and its ﬁrst publication in 2000 no studies have evaluated any discrepancies in the surgical treatment received among women with breast cancer apart from Wang et al analysing different age groups To our best knowledge this is the ﬁrst study that analyses the patterns of surgical treatment after taking socioeconomic status and insurance into consideration based on an Australian population of women with early breast cancer As illustrated in Figures 2 and 4 reconstruction following a mastectomy is the most likely surgical procedure for the higher socioeconomic population and patients with private insurance On the other hand a mastectomy is the most likely surgical procedure for the lower socioeconomic population and patients who do not have private insurance As outlined in the NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Early Breast Cancer a signiﬁcant proportion of women who have had a mastectomy report major psychological distress relating to their body image including being unable to look at themselves naked and a low self esteem 7 Furthermore women who have a breast reconstruction report a number of beneﬁts including psychologic and social adjustment to their breast cancer and surgical treatment received 8 No woman suffering from breast cancer should be denied the opportunity of a complete surgical 4 azzopardi et al 35 Breast conserving surgery 30 Percentage per procedure 25 Mastectomy alone 20 15 10 Reconstruc on 5 0 1 N

being independently assessed our results demonstrate consistent discrepancies in the surgical treatment received among the different patient groups within each demographic category We propose ﬁnancial well being to be a likely common factor between patients with private insurance and those classiﬁed as being part of the higher socioeconomic population responsible for such differences Our results may therefore suggest that the option of reconstructive breast surgery is a less realistic outcome for a patient from a less afﬂuent background In the assessment of a patient suspected of having breast cancer the combination of mammography an Figure 3 Insurance status and diagnostic procedure p 0 001 ultrasound and FNA cytology in addition to the clinical examination provides the highest diagnostic accuracy and lowest risk of diagnostic error 3 As illustrated in Figure 1 patients that are most likely to beneﬁt from FNA in adherence to this guideline are patients from the higher socioeconomic population Once an absolute malignant diagnosis is made based on FNA cytology deﬁnite surgery may be sought without the need of further work up such as an open biopsy 9 A more invasive open biopsy may be obtained prior to surgery in a patient who has not had a histologic diagnosis despite a high suspicion of cancer 3 The lower socioeconomic population fails to beneﬁt from Social and

this group are in fact most likely to have an open biopsy With the NHMRC guidelines in mind this may indicate that the most disadvantaged patient group or the lower socioeconomic population is not adequately screened and presents with clinically obvious disease and thus unable to beneﬁt from a less invasive diagnostic test in an otherwise only suspicious lesion This may reﬂect poor conveyance of public health awareness campaigns to the lower socioeconomic population Adjusting public health messages speciﬁcally to different patient groups is probably necessary to improve compliance In comparison with other countries the overall health and well being of Australians is relatively high However there are signiﬁcant disparities in health outcomes amongst different populations 6 Disadvantaged Australians have higher levels of disease risk factors and lower use of preventative health services than those who experience socioeconomic advantage 10 This study continues to illustrate the disparity in the surgical treatment received between a higher and lower socioeconomic status As discussed above a mastectomy is the most likely surgical procedure for a patient from the lower socioeconomic population However the actual surgical outcome for these women with early breast cancer is no surgery at all in contrast to the higher socioeconomic population for whom this is the least likely outcome Some mechanisms leading to the lower socioeconomic population receiving suboptimal care have been proposed Another important consideration is the extent of the presence or absence of patient decision making throughout the management of disease Furthermore a similar analyses to this study based on data including a range of stages of disease beyond just early breast cancer would be of great interest to attempt to ﬁnd out whether patients from a lower socioeconomic population present with higher stage disease and whether this may be responsible for some of the outcomes discussed The SEIFA index of relative disadvantage has limitations that need to be kept in mind Socioeconomic classiﬁcation is only a framework which may be used to classify and compare data No demographic classiﬁcation can be safely used to substitute another variable without appropriate testing of assumptions 6 azzopardi et al CONCLUSIONS Socioeconomic status and insurance have both been demonstrated to be associated with treatment for women with early breast cancer with the disparities outlined An opportunity exists to evaluate whether these patterns are consistent with any morbidity and survival differences among the two category groups as well as to attempt to discern further the processes responsible for suboptimal care Acknowledgments The Authors acknowledge that the data
