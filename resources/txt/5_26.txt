Introduction to Arabic Speech Recognition Using CMUSphinx System H Satori 1 2 M Harti 1 2 and N Chenfour 2 1 UFR Informatique et Nouvelles Technologies d Information et de Communication B P 1796 Dhar Mehraz E mail hsnsatori yahoo fr Although Arabic is currently one of the most widely spoken language in the world there has been relatively little speech recognition research on Arabic compared to the other languages 9 11 The first works on Arabic ASR has concentrated on developing recognizers for modern standard Arabic MSA The most difficult problems in developing highly accurate ASRs for Arabic are the predominance of non diacritized text material the enormous dialectal variety and the morphological complexity D Vergyri et al investigate the use of morphology based language model at different stages in a speech recognition system for conversational Arabic 9 K Kirchhoff et al 10 investigate the recognition of dialectal Arabic and study the discrepancies between dialectal and formal Arabic in the speech recognition point of view D Vergyri et al 11 investigate the automatic diacritizing Arabic text for use in acoustic model training for ASR CMU Carnegie Mellon University Sphinx speech recognition system is freely available and currently is one of the most robust speech recognizers in English This system enables research groups with modest budgets to quickly begin conducting research and developing applications In this work we attempt to build an ASR based on CMU Sphinx for the Arabic language We describe our experience for the extension of this system into Arabic language Abstract In this paper Arabic was investigated from the speech recognition problem point of view We propose a novel approach to build an Arabic Automated Speech Recognition System ASR This system is based on the open source CMU Sphinx 4 from the Carnegie Mellon University CMU Sphinx is a large vocabulary speaker independent continuous speech recognition system based on discrete Hidden Markov Models HMMs We build a model using utilities from the OpenSource CMU Sphinx We will demonstrate the possible adaptability of this system to Arabic voice recognition Keywords Speech recognition Arabic language HMMs CMUSphinx 4 Artificial intelligence I INTRODUCTION Automatic Speech Recognition ASR is a technology that allows a computer to identify the words that a person speaks into a microphone or telephone It has a wide area of applications Command recognition Voice user interface with the computer Dictation Interactive Voice Response it can be used to learn a foreign language ASR can help also handicapped people to interact with society It is a technology which makes life easier and very promising 1 View the importance of ASR too many systems are developed the most popular are Dragon Naturally Speaking IBM Via voice Microsoft SAPI Open source speech recognition systems are available too such as HTK 2 ISIP 3 AVCSR 4 and CMU Sphinx 4 5 7 We are interested to this last which is based on Hidden Markov Models HMMs 8 A Hidden Markov Model HMM is a statistical model where the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unknown parameters and the challenge is to determine the hidden parameters from the observable parameters based on this assumption The extracted model parameters can then be used to perform further analysis for example for pattern recognition applications Its extension into foreign languages II PHINX English is the standard represent a real research challenge area Fig 1 CMUSphinx logo A Presentation 1 Sphinx 4 Sphinx 4 speech recognition system has been jointly developed by the Carnegie Mellon University Sun Microsystems Laboratories and Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories M E R L It has been built entirely in Java TM programming language Since his starting the Sphinx Group is dedicated to release a set of reasonably mature speech components Those provide a basic technology level to anyone interested in creating speech recognition systems Since 2000 first with CMU Sphinx I CMU Sphinx II CMU SphinxTrain then CMU Sphinx III and CMUSphinx 4 a large part of CMU Sphinx project has been made available as open source packages 12 14 2 SphinxTrain SphinxTrain is the acoustic training environment for CMU Sphinx for sphinx2 sphinx3 and sphinx4 which was first publicly released on June 7th 2001 It is a suite of programs script and documentation for building acoustic models from data for the Sphinx suite of recognition engines With this contribution people should be able to build models for any language and condition for which there is enough acoustic data It is not possible to proceed to the recognition without having an acoustic model which is necessary to compare the data coming from FrontEnd see Fig 2 This model should be prepared using Sphinx Train tool B Architecture The Sphinx 4 architecture has been designed with a high degree of flexibility and modularity Each labelled element in Figure 2 represents a module that can be easily replaced allowing researchers to experiment with different module implementations without needing to modify other portions of the system The main blocks in Sphinx 4 architecture are frontend decoder and Linguist Fig 2 Sphinx 4 Architecture the main blocks are the FrontEnd the Decoder and the Linguist Front End it parameterizes an impute signal e g audio into a sequence of output features It performs Digital Signal Processing DSP on the incoming data Feature The outputs of the front end are features used for decoding in the rest of the system Linguist Or knowledge base it provides the information the decoder needs to do its job It is made up of three modules which are Acoustic Model Contains a representation often statistical of a sound created by training using many acoustic data Dictionary It is responsible for determining how a word is pronounced Language Model It contains a representation often statistical of the probability of occurrence of words Search Graph The graph structure produced by the linguist according to certain criteria e g the grammar using knowledge from the dictionary the acoustic model and the language model Decoder It is the main bloc of the Sphinx 4 system which performs the bulk of the work It reads features from the front end couples this with data from the knowledge base and feedback from the application and performs a search to determine the most likely sequences of words that could be represented by a series of features C Installation 1 Sphinx 4 Sphinx 4 can be downloaded either in binary format or in source codes 15 It was compiled and tested on several versions of Linux and on Windows operating systems Running building and testing sphinx 4 requires additional software and the D Implementation The Sphinx 4 implementation consists of 1 A phoneme is the smallest element of speech that indicates a difference in meaning word or sentence In this paper we describe our experience to create and develop an Arabic Version of CMU Sphinx 4 speech recognition system In what follows we present a Hello_Arabic_Digit application for the recognition of the ten Arabic digits Table 1 An automatic Speech recognizer system like Sphinx 4 uses three types of language dependent models An acoustic model which represents statistically a range of possible audio representations for the phonemes A pronunciation dictionary specifying how each word is pronounced in terms of the phonemes in the acoustic model A language model or grammar model which models patterns of word usage This is normally customized for the application Every word in the language model must be in the pronunciation dictionary In Hello_Arabic_Digits we proceed to the modification of those three elements to fit to our application 1 Corpus preparation An in house corpus was created from all 10 Arabic digits A number of 6 Moroccan speakers 6 males were asked to utter all digits 5 times Hence the corpus consists of 5 repetitions of every digit produced by each speaker Depending on this the corpus consists of 300 tokens During the recording session each utterance was played back to ensure that the entire digit was included in the recorded signal All the 300 10 Table 1 Ten Arabic digits how to pronounce them type of syllable IPA representation 24 and number of syllables in every spoken digit 25 Table 2 Results of the test of Hello_Arabic_Digit application 11 D Vergyri K Kirchhoff Auto matic diacritization of Arabic for acoustic modelling in speech recognition In Ali Farghaly andKarine Megerdoomian editors COLING 2004 Computational Approaches to Arabic Script based Languages pp Fig 3 Execution of the Hello_Arabic_Digit application Results are very satisfactory taken into account the very small size of the corpus of training personal corpus which was used if compared with corpora used for English IV CONCLUSION To conclude a spoken Arabic recognition system was designed to investigate the process of automatic speech recognition This system was based on CMUSphinx 4 from Carnegie Mellon University An application Hello_Arabic_Digit was presented to demonstrate the possible adaptability of this system to Arabic speech We project to extend to application for wide Arabic language recognition especially for the Moroccan dialect language REFERENCES A
