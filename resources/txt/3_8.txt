E Participation in the Legislative Process Procedural and Technological Lessons from Estonia Andrew Glencross European University Institute Via dei Roccettini 9 San Domenico FI I 50014 Italy Andrew Glencross eui eu http tidywork pbwiki com Abstract This paper assesses the success of an innovative national e participation project in Estonia To carry out this task the paper combines quantitative aggregate user data content analysis via tagging traffic sources and qualitative individual user survey and interviews with public officials data analysis The analysis is conducted with two principal research objectives in mind Firstly to explain how e participation has fared in Estonia both in terms of citizen mobilization and government responses The second goal is to evaluate a series of procedural and technological changes for enhancing e participation The Estonian case provides ample lessons for ensuring that e participation in practice can better meet the expectations of users and government officials alike Introduction In 2001 the Estonian State Chancellery launched a web based e participation application known as TOM the acronym for Today I Decide in Estonian https www eesti ee tom ideas py avaleht This was a pioneering move1 since 1 Estonia an EU member state of 1 3 million inhabitants is also known for its groundbreaking use of internet voting In 2007 it was the first country to introduce e voting for national legislative elections Trechsel 2007 Breuer and Trechsel 2006 1 TOM enables Estonian citizens to participate in the national legislative process other e participation initiatives around the globe have so far been restricted to the municipal local or sub national level Avdic et al 2007 Carman 2007 Seaton 2005 In continuous operation since 2001 the Estonian TOM platform provides an invaluable data set for understanding the dynamics of e participation This paper thus analyses the implementation of TOM and draws certain procedural how the tool is best used by citizens and government and technological functionalities offered to users lessons about using the internet to facilitate citizen input in legislative decision making According to the OECD conceptual framework for categorizing varieties of eengagement the TOM platform perfectly fits the model for using Information and Communication Technologies ICTs to promote active citizen participation as opposed to providing information or as a consultation mechanism2 OECD 2001 15 6 The relationship between citizens and government assumed by the TOM platform is thus one of partnership The promise of e participation is precisely the ability to deploy ICTs to establish a partnership between governed and governing so as both to counteract the declining public confidence in democratic institutions Schmitter and Trechsel 2004 and meet new expectations of increased popular participation in governance Dalton 2004 E participation is therefore one of the reforms that representative democracies are currently experimenting with in the hope that participation counteracts public disillusionment It has thus been conceptualized as advocacy democracy Cain et al 2003 as opposed to representative reform such as tinkering with the electoral system or candidate selection or direct democracy reforms By contrast with direct democracy advocacy democracy which includes e participation initiatives such as TOM seeks to influence the decision making process rather than make outright decisions as is done with referendums ibid 11 Hence this Estonian case study presents an ideal test for examining what it takes to get the 2 On consultation see for instance the growing literature on e rulemaking in US federal agencies regulatory rulemaking Shulman 2003 2 most out of e participation meaning the paper straddles the two major axes of eparticipation analysis decriptive to understand the e participation phenomenon and instrumental to discuss how it can be improved Rose et al 2007 7 The paper is structured as follows A first section presents the quantitative analysis of TOM engendered citizen mobilization Section two introduces the qualitative usage data and complements this with interviews with government officials to explore the expectations frustrations and satisfaction of using TOM both from a citizen to government perspective C2G and government to citizen G2C The third section signifying the shift from descriptive understanding to instrumental analysis draws on this data to provide a series of procedural how the TOM tool is used in context and technological the functionalities it offers to users suggestions for enhancing e participation with this tool A concluding section fits this argument into a more theoretical discussion of political participation In particular the extent to which e participation initiatives offer new possibilities for citizens to express voice meaning an attempt to improve the relationship between governed and governing by virtue of the former expressing grievances and proposals for reform Hirschman 1970 1 Estonian E Participation Usage Analysis First of all it must be pointed out that the TOM project is more ambitious than an e petition platform such as the United Kingdom s http petitions pm gov uk or Scotland s http epetitions scottish parliament uk 3 Rather than being a mere medium for collecting signatures the TOM tool is a forum for citizens to discuss legislative proposals within a ten day period following submission and to vote upon them After an idea has been proposed the system functions as follows To allow for discussion between TOM users authors of legislative proposals have three days to amend them before they are voted upon by users 3 The literature on e petitioning initiatives is still in its infancy For more information on the Scottish case see Carman 2007 and Seaton 2005 3 a simple 50 plus one majority is needed to pass Once a proposal is backed by a majority it is forwarded to the relevant government department which then has a month to respond to the proposal explaining what action was or was not taken and why This formal government response is then posted on TOM The data analysis presented in this section presents the usage statistics including the number of proposals their subject matter their authorship and official government response and traces trends in usage whilst also identifying the factors explaining variations and patterns in usage In addition Google Analytics is used to discover the source of visitors to the TOM platform Thus we describe the number of ideas proposed the nature of those ideas the number of users taking advantage of the TOM system where internet traffic came from and what the official government response was towards these ideas The Number of TOM Generated Ideas and How they Fared When Voted on by the User Community Table 1 indicates the yearly number of citizen generated legislative ideas that were proposed courtesy of TOM from 2001 to the end of 2006 in total 1045 legislative ideas were put forward using TOM The first year was the most successful in terms of the generation of legislative ideas with the number of TOM legislative proposals dropping from a 2001 peak of 369 to almost a quarter 97 in 2004 Thereafter the number of ideas climbed to 144 by 2006 still only 40 of the number of TOM generated ideas in its launch year of 2001 The initial peak of activity can easily be explained by the fact that during its launch year TOM received plentiful media coverage including a prominent presence on Estonia s most popular portal delfi ee Figure 1 Yearly Number of TOM generated legislative ideas 4 Of these 1045 TOM generated legislative ideas at the time of conducting this study March 2007 1025 had completed the TOM e participation process 4 Amongst this total of 1025 completed TOM proposals 654 or 64 were voted in by registered users 371 34 were voted out whilst 25 2 were stillborn and were not communicated to the government as they attracted no votes before the cut off point 3 days after first being proposed as shown in Table 1 Table 1 Voting on TOM Ideas N Total TOM Generated 1025 Percentage of total ideas 100 Ideas Ideas Voted In 654 64 Ideas Voted Out 371 34 Ideas Abandoned no 25 2 4 Of the twenty that had not 2 were still under discussion 5 were yet to be voted on and 13 were still awaiting a government response 5 votes The Subject Matter of TOM Generated Ideas One of the drawbacks of the current version of TOM is the inability to categorize proposals by subject matter the platform does not classify ideas according to content but merely lists them in the order in which they are proposed The absence of subject categorization creates several problems it impedes citizens ability to find or track topics that are of interest leads to a duplication of proposals and hampers the process of learning from already posted government responses Hence to track the content of TOM generated ideas we tagged all 1045 legislative ideas with a set of keywords and the database thus created was posted to the social bookmarking site del icio us 5 This permitted the creation of a striking visual representation of the most popular subject matter as can be seen in Figure 2 below Figure 2 Tagged Content of TOM Generated Ideas Most Popular 5 The full set of tagged ideas can be seen at http del icio us tom al icio us 6 Using a more classical representation Table 2 below shows the top ten most popular subjects for TOM generated ideas also rendered into English Table 2 Top Ten Most Popular

TOM platform attracted 6837 registered users Visiting the site was possible without registration but registration was required for authoring commenting and voting on legislative proposals The intention was to provide a forum for citizens to debate the legislative proposals precisely in contrast with the passive nature of e petitioning However in practice the platform did not provide a successful medium for connecting the authors of legislative ideas with the wider user community in either the debating or voting phase This is evident from the data on author participation which shows that only 40 of authors commented on their own ideas and even fewer 34 actually voted on them Table 3 Author Participation in Commenting and Voting N Percentage of Total Total Legislative Ideas 1025 100 At least one comment 911 89 Author commented 411 40 Author voted 350 34 or 570 56 Author commented voted Of the total number of registered citizens 6837 45 were active users 3081 in total there were 6107 comments and 12502 votes This in itself is a very high percentage of active users since the phenomenon of lurkers users who never contribute or participate is particularly prominent in online communities 6 Nevertheless participation inequality is particularly noticeable with regards to authoring TOM generated ideas only 9 of registered users have authored a legislative proposal or 19 of active users However 34 of registered users voted on TOM generated ideas representing 75 of active users whilst 19 commented on proposals 41 of active users The full statistics of active users are shown in Table 4 below 6 Jakob Nielson Participation Inequality Encouraging More Users to Participate http www useit com alertbox participation_inequality html 8 Table 4 Statistics of Active Users n of total of active users Registered Users 6837 Users authoring 1idea 595 9 19 Users authoring more 134 2 4 61 1 2 than 1 idea Users authoring more than 2 ideas Average ideas per 1 78 user Users who

with more than 6 actions Average actions per 6 4 9 user At first glance this data indicating that a sizeable proportion of active users has performed more than one action could be interpreted as a very positive sign of TOM s ability to attract active users However a completely different result emerges when examining the proportion of activities by percentile categories of active users as shown in Table 5 Table 5 Proportion of TOM Activities Performed by Percentile Category Ideas Votes ComIdeas 7 Activity Top 1 18 26 30 32 Top 2 24 37 40 44 Top 3 28 45 47 51 Top 4 31 50 51 56 Top 5 34 54 55

are responsible for 70 of TOM activity including more than 40 of ideas and two thirds of all votes Moreover the system is in fact dominated by a single user who accounts for 10 of all TOM generated ideas Indeed the top two percentile of active users responsible for the generation of nearly a quarter of TOM legislative ideas consists of only ten users Although Time magazine s person of the year in 2006 was thanks to the 7 Note ComIdeas is not the total number of comments as counted for total activity but the number of ideas commented upon Hence multiple comments on one idea only count as a single ComIdea 10 proliferation of user generated web content You it should be obvious that Web 2 0 is no democratic panacea given besides the digital divide Warschauer 2004 the extreme inequality in rates of user participation as shown in the TOM data Internet Traffic and Traffic Sources Over the entire five year period the daily number of visits to the TOM site averaged 150 200 This number would peak to around 300 in the case where an author of a TOM idea would post a link to the idea on an online forum or mention it on a weblog To put this in comparison in the Estonian context the number of daily visits is akin to that of a moderately popular weblog or the homepage of a small company Using the public statistics of an Estonian webtracking site http tnsmetrix emor ee the TOM platform ranks alongside the website of the Baltic Business News a newsagency or certain public radio stations r4 ee the Russian language channel and klassikaraadio ee a classical music station Google Analytics a free service provided by the IT giant Google provides website statistics including the source of internet traffic as well as the length and frequency of visits This service was used to discover more about the peaks in visits to the TOM platform crucially revealing that all the traffic peaks were the result of a TOM generated proposal being discussed outside the TOM platform For instance the spike of 9 January 2007 which saw 317 visits to the TOM site was generated by referrals from a discussion board auto24 ee the website of a major newspaper epl ee and two weblogs all four of which referred to a particular TOM idea as demonstrated in Figure 3 a screenshot from Google Analytics 11 Figure 3 TOM Traffic Sources on 9 January 2007 Provided by Google Analytics At the time of this spike in traffic the most active TOM generated legislative proposal was idea number 2050 which dealt with urban parking legislation and which was linked in the four websites mentioned above The popularity of this subject arises from the fact that in Estonia there is no legislation permitting bad parking to be classed as a traffic or parking violation because of the restrictive nature of constitutional due process applicable for establishing such sanctions Certain European countries with similar legal hurdles circumvent this constitutional obstacle by having the regime of fines imposed for such traffic violations classed as local taxes raised on parking mistakes However no such legislation has been introduced in Estonia which prompted TOM users to ask for such a measure to deal with problem of reckless urban parking It was precisely this particular TOM proposal that was discussed on a popular forum auto24 ee commented upon in a newspaper article epl ee as well as publicized on two weblogs written by the author of the TOM legislative proposal 12 Thus by publicizing the policy issue and the TOM generated remedy across various websites internet traffic directed towards TOM hit a peak This is a crucial finding which suggests that public interest in e participation is greatly dependent on how the tool for citizen participation is publicized among internet users especially the weblog community Google Analytics also tracks the internet search engine keywords that bring people into contact with the TOM platform As can be seen from the following top 10 list of keywords generating TOM traffic the hit parade unsurprisingly consists of expressions related to the site s name but there are also two real names of TOM idea authors voters blurred here for privacy reasons Figure 4 The Top 10 List of Keywords Generating TOM Traffic 13 When examining search statistics beyond the top 10 traffic generating keywords it becomes obvious that a very notable amount of inbound traffic is generated by searches for the names of people who happen to have participated in TOM However it is impossible to say whether the searches were conducted because the name searched was known to have authored a proposal on TOM although prima facie this possibility seems highly unlikely Out of 5435 search phrases 1955 35 are names whilst out of 8783 search instances 3404 39 are names 8 TOM ranks pretty highly in Google searches often on the 1st or 2nd page so it is not unusual for a search for a person s real name to bring up in a prominent position the idea they have proposed voted on or commented upon The Eventual Outcome of TOM Generated Legislative Proposals Government departments to which TOM legislative ideas were sent for consideration officially had one month to respond to the proposal through a posting on the TOM website These responses were supposed to comment on the TOM idea as well as explain what action was or was not taken and why The TOM website actually has misled users about the rate of government response as it displays statistics showing that only 13 of ideas received an answer from the government In reality however the analysis of every single government response reveals that of the 654 TOM ideas successfully voted in 580 elicited an official government response an 89 response rate Furthermore each answer was categorized according to the nature of the government response those explaining how the problem can be addressed using existing legislation those informing TOM users that the solution to the problem is already in the pipeline as an amendment to current statutes those expressing a possible implementation of the idea 9 those generally supportive but with no commitment 8 A search phrase would be for instance a name such as Joe Bloggs The search could then reveal several TOM ideas by this one user thus leading to multiple search instances This explains why there are more search instances than search phrases 9 These possibly implemented proposals were either sent by the government to a working group or to a parliamentary commission or else the government explained they would be taken into account seriously when amending existing legislation 14 to implement those that were plainly negative mealy mouthed unclear answers and as a separate category TOM generated ideas that received positive answers and were implemented at least in part This categorization is of course partially subjective since lengthy answers could often contain criticism and praise Thus we categorized answers as positive if at least some element of the proposal was deemed worthy The distribution of government responses can be seen in Table 5 which shows that nearly half the answers were negative whilst only 9 ideas 1 of the total were implemented Table 5 The Nature of Government Responses to TOM Legislative Ideas Type of Answer N Percentage of total answers Negative 276 48 Existing legislation can solve 80 14 Amendment in progress 79 14 Unclear 58 10 the problem Supportive but not 43 7 implementation of 35 6 9 1 implemented Possible TOM idea Implemented at least partly 2 User Expectations Frustrations and Evaluations Interviews with Authors and Government Officials The qualitative data analysis presented here is based on three separate yet complementary elements a survey of TOM users interviews with authors of TOM ideas and interviews with public officials charged with responding to TOMgenerated ideas In addition to the quantitative data discussed in the previous section the qualitative data analysis enables us to complete the assessment of how well TOM functioned as a means for enabling e participation The User Survey of TOM Authors 15 An online survey was conducted among the registered users of TOM between 30 April and 14 May 2007 The questionnaire was sent to 80 persons who had presented ideas via TOM in the period June 2001 March 2007 The sample consisted of the authors of the ideas with the highest number of votes cast The survey was completed by 25 respondents a 31 completion rate The aim of the survey was to analyze the lifestory of the typical TOM generated idea focusing on how and why the idea came into being the efficiency and userfriendliness of the commenting editing and voting phase of the portal as well as the eventual outcome It did so by asking the following six questions What did you know about TOM before presenting your idea How and why did your idea come into being and how did it get to TOM What was your experience of using TOM like disregarding the quality of comments voting result and the eventual government response Could you evaluate the comments on your idea the voting process and the answer received from the government What functions should be added to TOM in order to make it more convenient to use and more effective What should be changed What could TOM be used for in addition to its present function What would you do with TOM given the possibility Only the most salient responses revealing expectations frustrations and evaluations will be discussed here Overall respondents were delighted that TOM existed and found the information presented on the portal explaining how to use the tool and propose ideas clear and sufficient The instructions concerning voting and commenting were also considered easy and thus no major technical changes to the platform were proposed Hence the general attitude towards the TOM website is positive although the visual design of the portal was criticized for being old fashioned The vast majority of those authoring a TOM proposal did so for personal workor family related reasons and to a lesser degree because of media coverage of a particular issue Upon reflection however users felt they had not spent sufficient time in formulating the idea as with the exception of one user who had consulted an outside expert they were all based purely on individual reflection 16 TOM authors also tended to be disappointed that they had not taken advantage of opportunities to advertise their legislative ideas in other fora In particular they expressed frustration at not being able to connect with other TOM users who might have comments or vote on their idea This attitude was closely associated with criticism of the absence of debate among TOM users Although comments were highly regarded as valuable and insightful it was acutely felt that there was not enough discussion or interaction amongst users In response to these drawbacks the survey revealed that authors would have preferred the ability to edit their ideas whilst still in the commenting phase Moreover users felt that as potential voters and commentators they needed better ways of keeping track of new TOM ideas through the use of tagging RSS feeds and email notification as a means of facilitating debate However despite the unmet expectations of inter user debate the survey demonstrated that authors nonetheless found the voting procedure fair and legitimate The significance of this trust in the procedural fairness of the e participation system must be underscored since one study of e petitioning concludes that process evaluations far exceed outcome evaluations in influencing petitioner public support Carman 2007 13 TOM thus meets the criterion of being considered by citizens as politically neutral and potentially influential ibid 6 which is seen as the sine qua non of a successful participatory innovation The obstacles to contributing comments on TOM generated ideas were not perceived as solely a problem of platform design due to the absence of tags feeds or email notification Survey respondents repeatedly mentioned how they felt they lacked the relevant knowledge and information necessary in order to be able to post comments and participate in thorough discussions As most of the TOM generated ideas concern a very specific policy area and require a certain amount of background information the number of people commenting on TOM ideas is low and the persons involved in commenting and voting tend to be the same ones Moreover the reputation of TOM is considered high a perception 17 users referred to as the reason for not posting low quality or offensive comments that are the norm in many Internet forums Besides the lack of discussion the major criticism dwarfing in fact the negative comments on the paucity of user debate of the TOM e participation initiative was reserved for public officials answers to the TOM generated ideas All the respondents received negative answers i e the presented idea were not to be implemented and all the answers are described as being too general and mealymouthed This was interpreted by respondents as the sign of an unwillingness on the part of civil servants to contribute to the possible implementation of an idea which respondents believe is merely seen as extra work by these public officials Some frustrated respondents ascribed civil servant inability to implement TOMgenerated ideas to the latter s low status and lack of higher level political support The absence of positive government responses to TOM generated ideas thus resulted in the respondents overall pessimism regarding the usefulness of the portal that can be illustrated with the statements like nothing will change anyway or our opinion doesn t count etc This finding confirms the real problem of unmet expectations associated with e participation as also shown by one study of the Scottish e petitioning experiment revealing that nearly 60 of users felt that online petition failed to develop stronger links between governed and governing ibid 11 Interviews with the Authors of TOM Ideas In addition to the user survey a smaller number of authors of ideas with a high vote count or ideas the government said had the possibility of implementation were contacted for private interviews The aim was to discover what changes users wished to see implemented in order to counteract the problems revealed by the user survey These interviews revealed that authors sought four substantive changes to the TOM platform concerning functionality publicity information and influence Invariably these proposals all had a complementary 18 goal namely unleashing the full potential of e participation by increasing the use and impact of TOM The first and perhaps most well spelled out demand was for various nonnegligible improvements to the functionality of the TOM platform Authors called for the introduction of a quorum of votes for approving an idea in the hope of improving the quality of ideas submitted to the government In addition there is a clear desire to improve the feedback flow throughout the different stages of the TOM process in the drafting phase once in the hands of the government and after the formal answer At the initial stage of devising an idea authors explained how they required information on whether there had been previous attempts to address similar policy problems via TOM and how these had fared They also wanted to be kept abreast of how a voted in idea was progressing through the relevant department tracking the progress of an idea is a common concern across e petitioning initiatives ibid and felt even more strongly that it was necessary to introduce a discussion stage after the eventual government response In the existing system users are not notified of government responses this demand was also combined with the suggestion of creating the possibility of re submitting an amended idea following a negative answer Finally authors agreed that they were an integral part of the solution for publicizing TOM Hence they suggested the introduction of a send to a friend function as a way of establishing a campaign around TOM generated ideas Closely related to this send to a friend function was the authors second demand was for the TOM platform to be publicized better in the Estonian public sphere As shown in the usage analysis TOM was at its most popular in its debut year when TOM ideas were carried on a major Estonian webportal a link authors fully supported Authors felt more creativity was needed in order to generate publicity for instance by inviting appropriate NGOs to support relevant TOMgenerate ideas once they had been voted upon in order to create a lobby effect 19 Thirdly authors repeatedly requested that the TOM platform make more information available in order to assist the development of ideas In particular authors want TOM to provide links to documents relevant for devising legislative ideas as well as external discussion forums This would also be complemented by providing TOM users with information regarding the working plans of government ministries including legal amendments in process or under consideration The availability of this information would thus allow users to suggest ideas that would be congruent with current government priorities thereby ensuring a better positive response rate Finally data should also be provided concerning the official responses to TOM ideas received by each government ministry Fourthly it was considered vital to increase the influence of TOM generated ideas on public policy in Estonia Besides improving functionality publicity and information which should all indirectly if not directly increase TOM influence interviewees thought the potential political impact of TOM ought to be extended beyond merely delivering ideas to government departments In particular it was suggested that ideas should also be circulated automatically to the relevant parliamentary committees as well as the coalition council Interviews with Public Officials To provide a balanced and complete picture of Estonia s e participation initiative representatives of relevant government ministries handling TOM generated ideas were also interviewed The participants were public servants who dealt with the TOM ideas the State Chancellery had forwarded them Their feedback provides a crucial insight into their perceptions of certain defects in the current TOM system and also reveals the types of changes they are willing to countenance The first and most sizeable problem from the civil servants perspective is the fact that ideas have passed through the system with very few votes as well as often being disproportionately authored by a select few users Nonetheless the quality 20 of TOM generated ideas was considered higher than the general correspondence from citizens that finds its way into the ministry inbox Hence there was a willingness to see the TOM system improved as a way of lessening the burden of answering letters from citizens A second complaint concerns users expectations of establishing a policy dialogue with the government courtesy of civil servants responses to TOMgenerated ideas As with e petitioning ibid 10 TOM users expect that the internet provides a unique and hitherto inexistent means of having their voice heard by government In practice this entails burdening civil servants with the task of responding to TOM generated ideas Under the terms of the Estonian Public Information Act Estonian citizens already have a far reaching right to make public information requests However TOM generated ideas are more difficult and time consuming to treat because they typically require a more complex answer one that is taken at a higher administrative level than a public information request Consequently answers to TOM generated ideas are treated as the official government position This means the possibilities of citizen to government dialogue using the TOM platform are limited since once a government position has been determined civil servants are obliged in public to defend it Civil servants thus pointed out that TOM induced unrealistic expectations of civil servants ability to effect policy change their function is to execute rather than decide public policy Nonetheless the interviewees accepted that TOM would be made more effective by providing users with the working plans of government ministries as well as allowing TOM generated ideas to be supported by NGOs and other advocacy groups 3 Enhancing E Participation What Technological and Procedural Changes Are Needed 21 The above quantitative and qualitative analysis singled out two overarching problems with the current TOM tool poor citizen mobilization and the low impact of TOM generated legislative ideas Both are symptomatic of TOM s limited ability to influence democratic legislative decision making in Estonia All modifications to the TOM platform therefore have to target ultimately the issue of unmet expectations about e participation s ability to engender new forms of citizen to government and government to citizen interaction In this sense the problem of TOM is one of the burden of expectations which is also true of most areas of the nascent e democracy Schulman 2003 The value of this paper s in depth study of Estonia s e participation experiment is thus precisely the ability to identify the types of changes necessary to help unleash the potential of this new form of democratic interaction The study of the TOM data clearly demonstrated that the advent of the technological possibility of enabling citizens to participate in the legislative process was not by itself a sufficient condition for achieving a transformation in democratic practices This merely confirms the fact that the simple causal interpretation of ICTs as leading to automatic change in social systems technological determinism Hansen 1921 Heilbroner 1967 is erroneous Preston 2001 just as functionalism is far from always being the most persuasive explanation of particular institutional arrangements Pierson 2000 Rather than constituting a sphere separate from social life it appears that technology is constitutive of social life Mackenzie and Wajcman 1999 23 and the recommendations for improving TOM take account of this fact Instead of representing a democratic deus ex machina cf Sunstein 2000 therefore e participation needs to be embedded in the social and political landscape of a particular polity if it is to fulfil any of its potential for empowering citizens This is why on the basis of the data analysis we suggest a series of procedural changes viz how TOM is used by government so as to address the problem of embedding e participation into the public sphere This type of change requires political will in order to be put into practice Nevertheless technology is 22 by no means neglected since the analysis also points to the need for certain technological emendations concerning the functionalities10 the existing TOM platform offers to citizens keen to participate in the legislative process Problems with the Existing TOM Tool The Causes The intertwined causes behind poor citizen mobilization and the low impact of TOM in the Estonian public sphere can be summarized as follows Poor Mobilization Few users Dominance of a few mega users Authors disappointed by the lack of user comments No linkage between the authoring commenting and voting phases Little discussion of government responses as no user notification of responses No possibility of re submitting revised ideas Low Impact Public officials contemptuous of low public participation rate Answering is a burden on civil servants Ideas do not correspond with ministerial priorities Civil servants in charge of responding do not make policy decisions they execute TOM generated ideas are lost once responded to they drop out of policy debate as civil servants defend official line Suggested Technological Changes Improving TOM s User Functionality Impact is directly related to the number of TOM users in particular the number of user votes each idea musters The current TOM tool only requires a simple 10 Thus the analysis does not dwell on software related issues 23 majority of votes to allow an idea to pass there is no quorum This was interpreted by civil servants as a major weakness because it meant that they had to respond to ideas through a formal cumbersome process on the basis of a mere handful of votes To avoid this awkward situation an adjustable quorum could be introduced to ensure that the ideas presented to the various government ministries have the backing of a more significant number of users The quorum would be set in proportion to the total number of registered users so that greater citizen mobilization would be reflected directly in the voting process As a result the ideas voted in will have the sanction of a greater number of users thereby increasing the chances that the government and other interested parties will take them seriously Consequently ideas voted in by only a small number of users would not burden civil servants thereby avoiding removing a major source of their frustration with TOM The current TOM tool subdivides the practice of e participation into different phases once an idea is proposed discussion revision followed by voting As shown in the qualitative analysis TOM users authors in particular expressed dissatisfaction with the linkages between these separate phases Invariably users explained that there was no way of keeping track of discussion and revision of TOM generated ideas which led to frustration and disengagement with the e participation process For instance authors were disinclined to remain engaged in e participation in the face of the indifference of other users as indicated by a lack of comments This flaw can be remedied thanks to the introduction of a comprehensive system of categorizing TOM generated ideas which would further allow for a search of TOM ideas by tags or categories as well as a notification system for alerting users to new or cognate ideas The categorization of legislative ideas is easy to accomplish using a social bookmarking service such as www del icio us which would assign tags in essence keywords to each idea and relevant comments The introduction of comprehensive tagging of all legislative ideas and comments on the TOM tool 24 would have two immediate benefits Firstly it would make it much less likely that an existing proposal would simply be duplicated Secondly and more importantly searchable tags would assist authors when proposing new legislative ideas in cognate areas A searchable database would enable potential authors to make contact with previous authors and those who have commented on relevant previous ideas thereby making it easier to mobilize a community of eparticipation users to support a TOM generated idea Furthermore the knowledge that comments will be stored for future use should also act as a disincentive for users to post ad hominem messages replying to an argument or factual claim by attacking or appealing to the person making the argument or claim rather than by addressing the substance of the argument or producing evidence against the claim Tagging needs to be complemented by the introduction of a system of email notification or RSS feed Really Simple Syndication an automatic system for alerting subscribers of updated website content without them having to visit the actual website automatically informing users of new ideas in certain policy areas In addition this system could alert authors to comments on their ideas Likewise the RSS feed function would also notify commentators if an author amended her legislative proposal TOM users suggestion of introducing a send to a friend function also represents an optimal solution for increasing awareness of the e participation platform as well as a way to generate more user discussion Authors were particularly disappointed with the lack of information regarding the progress of their TOM idea once successfully voted upon and sent to a government ministry A remedy for this would be the creation of an automatic system by email notification or RSS whereby authors and other users can track the progress of a voted in idea in the stages leading up to the official government response This would not only enhance the transparency of the e participation process thereby showing that the government takes the fruits of e participation seriously It would also enable the user community to mobilize in the crucial 25 period of government decision making by allowing users to know the timing of government decisions and thus organize their mobilization accordingly Indeed this notification system should also encompass the eventual government response as the interviews with authors indicated that they were particularly dissatisfied by the failure of the existing tool to signal a government response to their idea Government responses could then also be tagged and added to the searchable TOM database so as to help authors of new ideas to discover previous government responses to ideas similar to theirs Furthermore government responses would make an ideal subject for comments thereby increasing citizen to citizen interaction within the user community potentially acting as a means for generating improved ideas Finally the existing TOM tool does not allow for the resubmission of rejected ideas a flaw TOM users according to the analysis above want to see rectified Thus a system for revising and resubmitting ideas would represent a significant improvement of the e participation tool Depending on the type of response a TOM generated idea received from the government the resubmission facility should allow users to amend the legislative proposal accordingly It seems only appropriate however that a newly amended proposal for resubmission should also be subject to a new vote by the community of users Resubmission could thus potentially serve to reflect the intensity of citizens preferences adding to the pressure on government for a positive response especially if the idea was supported by third parties such as NGOs or political actors Suggested Procedural Changes Changing the Way Government Uses EParticipation Perhaps the Estonian government s biggest shortcoming in its use of eparticipation is its failure to publicize the TOM platform However this shortcoming seems endemic in e participation initiatives A United Nations study of this nascent field of e democracy recently concluded that one of the main 26 reasons for lack of interest in e participation stems from the fact that public authorities do not take the trouble to market the initiative or explain the use and advantage of e participation efforts UN 2007 123 Figure 1 showed that the launch year when TOM legislative proposals were carried by Estonia s most popular webportal saw the most TOM generated ideas If the government is serious therefore about realizing the full potential of e participation it must take positive steps towards better advertising the existence of the TOM platform These steps can vary across different media yet are nevertheless simple to put into effect For instance internet portals and online newspapers can be mandated to incorporate permanent links to TID in their current affairs coverage Likewise traditional print media newspapers and periodicals as well as TV and radio coverage especially public broadcasting could mention the TOM website even if only in a byline as a forum for further public debate or for demanding government action By itself the existence of an e participation platform counts for little unless it is actively promoted as a means to pass new legislation Advertising alone is no nostrum for ensuring the success of e participation If TOM is to have a greater impact it seems that the ideas it generates ought not to be circulated solely to government ministries Citizen to government communication has to be understood more broadly in terms of a public sphere Habermas 1989 in which citizens participate and to which government is responsive Hence TOM generated ideas can contribute to public debate within the public sphere if these legislative proposals are also communicated directly to decision making actors such as parliamentary committees or even partisan or advocacy organizations such as political parties and NGOs In fact civil servants interviewed for this research approved the notion of allowing interest groups to express their support for TOM generated ideas during the phase of government consideration In this way e participation can have a greater impact on political decision making instead of being left in the hands of unelected public officials whose mission is to execute rather than decide public policy 27 One of the complaints common to both the authors of TOM ideas and civil servants was the fact that TOM generated ideas did not match ministerial priorities Consequently even ideas that did not require high level decisionmaking did not meet with a positive response To overcome this problem government needs to provide citizens using the e participation tool with detailed information on the current policy priorities of each government ministry This would enable potential authors of legislative proposals to tailor their suggestions to current priorities thereby increasing the chances that ideas generated via eparticipation will meet with a positive answer The final suggestion aimed at changing the way government uses e participation concerns the relationship between e participation and future statute amendments If the possible impact of e participation on the legislative process is to be maximized it seems fruitless to simply lose track of rejected legislative proposals Thus rejected ideas should be kept on file in the relevant ministries especially those rejected for their lack of congruence with current government priorities In this way subsequent statute amendment or policy priorities that might correspond with or relate better to earlier TOM generated ideas will not be lost and might well benefit from the input of earlier e participation debates Moreover this promise to safeguard and potentially re examine the usefulness of TOM generated ideas will also demonstrate the government s willingness to incorporate citizen input into the legislative process which as the interviews showed is a key element of citizens expectations about e participation If this expectation is not met trust in e participation as a cornerstone of reforming the democratic process in the twenty first century is likely to be undermined Conclusions The Importance of Being Earnest About E Participation E participation gives citizens an unprecedented ability to use their voice Hirschman 1970 in the democratic process This study has demonstrated 28 using data from the Estonian TOM initiative citizens trust in the e participation process However the analysis also revealed the extent to which citizens were frustrated by the inability of TOM to meet their expectations about having their voice heard only one percent of TOM generated ideas were implemented This finding only confirms the fact that the use of ICT alone cannot accelerate the democratic process because the process itself has to be thought through so that the use of ICT is designed to promote and nurture it UN 2007 121 Hence the greatest challenge to e participation is the threat of unmet expectations When conceptualized according to Hirschman s model of the interrelation between exit voice and loyalty it appears that the addition of a new outlet for voice in the form of e participation is no instant remedy for the problem of public distrust of political institutions Voice only succeeds in promoting loyalty if the use of voice leads to reform when voice becomes futile the result is exit in the sense of disengagement Hirschman 1970 From this perspective governments seeking to implement e participation appear not to have the option of doing so half heartedly Citizens willingness to trust the e participation process can only be sustained if the system has notable effects on the legislative decision making process To a certain extent as argued in section three being earnest about eparticipation is a product of offering the appropriate functionalities to users As the Estonian case shows the lack of certain functionalities hampered both the ability to create inter citizen debate within the e participation community and the ease with which citizens could be mobilized to join the community Yet the evidence also points to the crucial importance of political will in fulfilling the potential of e participation The irony is as revealed by the TOM case that this novel mechanism for bottom up political participation cannot rely solely on bottom up citizen engagement in order to be effective Rather top down coordination by government is required to place e participation at the heart of 29 public debate Only in this way can e participation begin to meet the expectations it has already engendered BIBLIOGRAPHY Avdic Anders Karin
