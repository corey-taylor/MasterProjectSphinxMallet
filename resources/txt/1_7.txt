Articles Effects of radiotherapy and of differences in the extent of surgery for early breast cancer on local recurrence and 15 year survival an overview of the randomised trials Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group EBCTCG Summary Background In early breast cancer variations in local treatment that substantially affect the risk of locoregional recurrence could also affect long term breast cancer mortality To examine this relationship collaborative metaanalyses were undertaken based on individual patient data of the relevant randomised trials that began by 1995 Methods Information was available on 42 000 women in 78 randomised treatment comparisons radiotherapy vs no radiotherapy 23 500 more vs less surgery 9300 more surgery vs radiotherapy 9300 24 types of local treatment comparison were identiﬁed To help relate the effect on local ie locoregional recurrence to that on breast cancer mortality these were grouped according to whether or not the 5 year local recurrence risk exceeded 10 Ͻ10 17 000 women Ͼ10 25 000 women Lancet 2005 366 2087 2106 Collaborators listed at end of report Correspondence to EBCTCG secretariat Clinical Trial Service Unit CTSU Richard Doll Building Old Road Campus University of Oxford Oxford OX3 7LF UK bc overview ctsu ox ac uk Findings About three quarters of the eventual local recurrence risk occurred during the ﬁrst 5 years In the comparisons that involved little Ͻ10 difference in 5 year local recurrence risk there was little difference in 15 year breast cancer mortality Among the 25 000 women in the comparisons that involved substantial Ͼ10 differences however 5 year local recurrence risks were 7 active versus 26 control absolute reduction 19 and 15 year breast cancer mortality risks were 44 6 versus 49 5 absolute reduction 5 0 SE 0 8 2pϽ0 00001 These 25 000 women included 7300 with breast conserving surgery BCS in trials of radiotherapy generally just to the conserved breast with 5 year local recurrence risks mainly in the conserved breast as most had axillary clearance and node negative disease 7 versus 26 reduction 19 and 15 year breast cancer mortality risks 30 5 versus 35 9 reduction 5

wall and regional lymph nodes with similar absolute gains from radiotherapy 5 year local recurrence risks mainly at these sites 6 versus 23 reduction 17 and 15 year breast cancer mortality risks 54 7 versus 60 1 reduction 5 4 SE 1 3 2p 0 0002 overall mortality reduction 4 4 SE 1 2 2p 0 0009 Radiotherapy produced similar proportional reductions in local recurrence in all women irrespective of age or tumour characteristics and in all major trials of radiotherapy versus not recent or older with or without systemic therapy so large absolute reductions in local recurrence were seen only if the control risk was large To help assess the life threatening side effects of radiotherapy the trials of radiotherapy versus not were combined with those of radiotherapy versus more surgery There was at least with some of the older radiotherapy regimens a signiﬁcant excess incidence of contralateral breast cancer rate ratio 1 18 SE 0 06 2p 0 002 and a signiﬁcant excess of non breast cancer mortality in irradiated women rate ratio 1 12 SE 0 04 2p 0 001 Both were slight during the ﬁrst 5 years but continued after year 15 The excess mortality was mainly from heart disease rate ratio 1 27 SE 0 07 2p 0 0001 and lung cancer rate ratio 1 78 SE 0 22 2p 0 0004 Interpretation In these trials avoidance of a local recurrence in the conserved breast after BCS and avoidance of a local recurrence elsewhere eg the chest wall or regional nodes after mastectomy were of comparable relevance to 15 year breast cancer mortality Differences in local treatment that substantially affect local recurrence rates would in the hypothetical absence of any other causes of death avoid about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years for every four local recurrences avoided and should reduce 15 year overall mortality Introduction In early breast cancer surgery can remove any disease that has been detected in or around the breast or regional lymph nodes but undetected deposits of disease may remain either locally ie in the residual breast tissue scar area chest wall or regional lymph nodes or at distant sites that could if untreated www thelancet com Vol 366 December 17 24 31 2005 develop into life threatening recurrence Many randomised trials over the past half century have studied the effects of radiotherapy and of the extent of surgery on local disease control and on cause speciﬁc mortality in early breast cancer This report updates previous meta analyses1 4 of the individual patient data from those trials 2087 Articles Post BCS radiotherapy After breast conserving surgery BCS a particularly common site of local recurrence is the conserved breast itself or the axilla if this has not been treated effectively The risk of recurrence in a conserved breast can be substantial even in node negative disease that has been conﬁrmed by axillary clearance and it can be greatly reduced by radiotherapy 4 5 Hence the recent National Institutes of Health NIH consensus conference on early breast cancer6 recommended that after BCS there should be radiotherapy to the conserved breast Recent surveys in North America and Europe indicate that this treatment is generally given 7 It is however not always given 8 since later recurrence in a conserved breast can usually be removed by further surgery Breast radiotherapy immediately after BCS could improve long term survival by comparison with a policy of watchful waiting for any local recurrence only if life threatening spread from tumour cells in the conserved breast would otherwise occur after BCS but before any clinically evident local recurrence was detected and treated or if the local disease could then not be controlled adequately Hence radiotherapy is likely to have little effect on early mortality whatever effect it might have on long term breast cancer mortality Post mastectomy radiotherapy Even after mastectomy an appreciable risk of local recurrence eg in the chest wall or lymph nodes can remain unless some reliable method of investigation such as axillary clearance has found no evidence of nodal involvement If axillary investigation reveals nodal involvement or if the axilla has not been adequately investigated post mastectomy radiotherapy can produce a substantial absolute reduction in this risk of local recurrence and previous trials9 12 and meta analyses2 4 have shown that although it has little effect on breast cancer mortality during the ﬁrst few years it can produce a moderate but deﬁnite reduction in longer term breast cancer mortality Hence the NIH consensus conference6 recommended radiotherapy after mastectomy for women at high risk of locoregional recurrence eg those with four or more involved lymph nodes was only marginally signiﬁcant in the trials of post BCS radiotherapy although more clearly signiﬁcant in those of post mastectomy radiotherapy Moreover in the data then available all cause mortality was not signiﬁcantly reduced by radiotherapy after either BCS or mastectomy More recently a review of just the published results from the post BCS radiotherapy trials found only a marginally signiﬁcant difference in all cause mortality but noted that an updated meta analysis of individual patient data would be more reliable 13 The present review of individual patient data from randomised trials of local treatments involves substantially longer follow up than our previous reviews 3 4 For the post BCS radiotherapy trials in particular many of which started relatively recently and for at least the most recent post mastectomy radiotherapy trials this longer followup should offer a much more reliable assessment of the long term effects on mortality The main results for these two particular comparisons are presented separately before the more general analyses that bring together data from all the local treatment comparisons The main aim of this report is to assess quantitatively the relationship between local control and long term breast cancer mortality It deals only semi quantitatively with the effects of some radiotherapy regimens on mortality several years later from other conditions eg heart disease and lung cancer14 16 and does not investigate the extent to which the long term fatal or nonfatal adverse effects of local treatment can be avoided by the substantial changes that have taken place over the past few decades in radiotherapy and surgery techniques 17 19 Methods Every 5 years since 1985 evidence from the randomised trials in early breast cancer has been reviewed centrally in a worldwide collaboration between the individuals now responsible for them as the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group EBCTCG An EBCTCG report published earlier this year20 gave the results up to the year 2000 from the trials that began by 1995 of systemic treatments chemotherapy or hormonal therapy for early breast cancer The present report gives the corresponding results from the trials of local treatments various types of surgery or radiotherapy or both using similar methods Long term follow up of mortality Moderate differences in mortality that take many years to emerge can best be assessed by systematic metaanalyses of the data on every individual patient in all relevant randomised trials Even this method of assessment however will yield reliable answers only if large numbers of relevant individuals have been randomised and followed up for many years Our previous reviews of individual patient data included follow up of the surgery trials only to 19903 and follow up of the radiotherapy trials4 only to 1995 In the latter review 4 the effect on long term breast cancer mortality 2088 Treatment comparisons and main outcomes Information was available table 1 from

techniques such as sentinel lymph node biopsy 21 were available Webtables 1 3 give brief design details of each of the available treatment comparisons in the three main parts of table 1 For all unconfounded randomised trials that began recruitment by 1995 information was sought for every patient on her initial characteristics allocated treatment and time to various outcomes These outcomes were breast cancer recurrence whether the ﬁrst such recurrence was a distant or an isolated local recurrence ie an ipsilateral locoregional recurrence occurring before any contralateral or other distant recurrence cause speciﬁc and overall mortality and the incidence of second primary cancers before breast cancer recurrence Data management procedures Trial identiﬁcation and data handling procedures were as in the EBCTCG report on systemic therapies 20 except that i more detail was sought of the surgical procedures radiotherapy regimens and deﬁnitions of local recurrence from protocols publications or correspondence see webtables 1 3 ii breast cancer in the contralateral breast was not counted as local recurrence iii more detail was sought by correspondence about the underlying causes of many of the deaths particularly from circulatory disease lung cancer or uncertain causes before any recurrence of breast cancer and iv more deﬁnite information was www thelancet com Vol 366 December 17 24 31 2005 sought by correspondence if it was unclear whether the ﬁrst recurrence was just an isolated local recurrence In treatment comparisons where the extent of axillary surgery was identical in both groups classiﬁcation of axillary nodal status as positive or negative was based on pathological information where available and on clinical information where not The few women with unknown nodal status were combined with those with clinically node positive disease In treatment comparisons where the extent of axillary surgery differed between the groups eg axillary surgery vs axillary radiotherapy classiﬁcation of nodal status was based only on clinical information to avoid bias For every randomised treatment comparison local recurrence was deﬁned in the same way for both groups In the trials of radiotherapy versus not this generally included recurrence or a new breast cancer in the residual breast tissue scar area chest wall or ipsilateral regional lymph nodes and in the trials involving surgery trial speciﬁc local recurrence deﬁnitions are given in webtables 2 and 3 Where recurrences just in a conserved breast or axilla had not originally been reported to the collaboration information on them was sought and they are now included as local recurrences Statistical analysis All analyses were stratiﬁed by trial by time since randomisation in single years and by

number of involved nodes Other aspects of the statistical methods and the formats of the ﬁgures are as before 20 unless otherwise indicated and are described on the EBCTCG website see panel In early breast cancer most local recurrences become apparent within the ﬁrst few years but much of the distant recurrence and breast cancer mortality occurs later 4 The main analyses involve 5 year local recurrence risks and 15year breast cancer mortality risks Both are generally illustrated by 15 year graphs for comparability with the EBCTCG report20 on systemic therapies but the logrank observed minus expected O E values that yield the signiﬁcance tests associated with such graphs are based on events throughout the entire period of follow up both during and after the ﬁrst 15 years unless otherwise indicated For the major treatment comparisons results for overall mortality any death are also given mainly on the website Collaborative review Preliminary meta analyses of the trials of local treatments had been presented and discussed at a meeting of collaborators in September 2000 after which much additional detail was sought about methods and outcomes in these trials and restructured corrected meta analyses emerged in 2004 A draft of the present 2090 report was circulated for comment by the collaborating trialists in June 2005 was presented and discussed at a further meeting of collaborators in September 2005 and was available for further comment in October 2005 It was revised substantially in the light of these comments and recirculated when submitted for publication in November 2005 and during the editorial process page proofs were posted on the passwordprotected EBCTCG website Role of the funding sources This collaboration is funded from the general long term ﬁnancial support of the CTSU by organisations that had no role in study design data collection data analysis data interpretation or writing of the report The EBCTCG secretariat had full access to all the data and analyses and after consultation with the collaborators had ﬁnal responsibility for the decision to submit for publication Results Table 1 shows the numbers of trials and the numbers of randomised women who contributed to various local treatment comparisons The two most extensively studied aspects of local treatment are radiotherapy after BCS 7311 women in 10 trials and radiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary clearance 9933 women in 25 trials The results subdivided by nodal status thereby making four separate treatment comparisons for these two particular sets of trials are presented ﬁrst Then information from all the treatment comparisons in table 1 again subdivided by nodal status making a total of 24 comparisons is used to relate the magnitude of the effect on local recurrence to that on breast cancer mortality Finally the effects of the radiotherapy regimens in these trials on the incidence of second cancers and on mortality from diseases other than breast cancer are presented Radiotherapy after BCS Figure 1 gives for the ten trials of post BCS radiotherapy logrank analyses of the effects on local recurrence upper part of ﬁgure and on breast cancer mortality lower part Separate subtotals are given a for trials in which the conserved breast was the only site irradiated sometimes with an additional boost to the scar and b for those where other sites were also irradiated such as the axilla and supraclavicular fossa One of the ten trials contributed to both subtotals so there are 11 strata in ﬁgure 1 The reduction in local recurrence mainly in the conserved breast produced by allocation to radiotherapy is substantial and highly signiﬁcant pϽ0 00001 in every separate trial There is no signiﬁcant heterogeneity between the

8b In every large trial of post mastectomy radiotherapy in women with node positive disease there was a similar proportional reduction in local recurrence showing that the radiotherapy regimens used in all the main trials recent or older were of comparable efﬁcacy in achieving local control webﬁgure 8b Hence when assessing the relevance of local control to long term breast cancer mortality it is appropriate to consider the evidence from both recent and older trials Comparison of post BCS and post mastectomy radiotherapy trials In the post BCS radiotherapy trials the site of local recurrence was generally available When it was over 90 578 of 636 of the local recurrences among controls involved the conserved breast as did over 90 of the effect of radiotherapy on local recurrence In the postmastectomy radiotherapy trials the site of local recurrence was not generally available However little breast tissue remains after mastectomy so the main effect of radiotherapy on local recurrence in these postmastectomy trials must involve other sites such as the chest wall or regional lymph nodes Coincidentally the 5 year risks of local recurrence without radiotherapy and the reduction in those risks produced by radiotherapy were similar among women with node negative disease in the post BCS trials and among women with node positive disease in the postmastectomy trials ﬁgure 2 upper panels and ﬁgure 3 lower panels The control 15 year breast cancer mortality was of course lower among women in the post BCS trials about 80 of whom had small tumours greatest dimension р20 mm and node negative disease than among women in the post mastectomy trials with node positive disease For both however it was substantial and for both the absolute reduction in breast cancer mortality with radiotherapy was about 5 The apparent similarity of the absolute reductions in 15 year breast cancer mortality in these two types of radiotherapy trial after similar absolute reductions in 5 year local recurrence risk suggests that the effect on long term survival of avoiding a recurrence in a conserved breast is approximately comparable with that of avoiding a recurrence at other locoregional sites Three categories of local treatment comparison To examine the general relationship between the effects of local treatment differences on local recurrence and their effects on breast cancer mortality all the treatment comparisons listed in table 1 were subdivided by nodal status making a total of 24 such comparisons These were then grouped arbitrarily into three categories according to www thelancet com Vol 366 December 17 24 31 2005 the absolute reduction Ͻ10 10 20 or Ͼ20 in the 5 year local recurrence risk The 24 white squares and their 99 CIs in ﬁgure 4 display these absolute reductions in risk The length of the side of each white square is inversely proportional to the standard error of the absolute reduction The vertical broken lines correspond to absolute reductions of 10 and 20 in risk and have been used as arbitrary cut points to group these 24 types of comparison into three categories according to the absolute reduction in this risk These categories involve respectively 17 000 20 000 and 5000 women with mean absolute reductions of 1 17 and 26 in the 5 year local recurrence risk Most of the substantial absolute reductions in local recurrence risk involved the addition of radiotherapy The others involved conservation of the breast or axilla or both without effective radiotherapy to the conserved tissue Furthermore almost all the comparisons of radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy involved substantial absolute reductions in local recurrence the one exception was that after mastectomy and axillary clearance in women with pathologically node negative disease the risk of local recurrence without radiotherapy was so low that no large absolute reduction was possible ﬁgures 3 and 4 In the lower part of ﬁgure 4 the four earliest trials those starting during 1951 1970 webﬁgure 10 had high local recurrence risks despite radiotherapy Omission of these early trials from subsequent analyses would make no material difference to the main conclusions Local control and long term breast cancer mortality The absolute reductions in breast cancer mortality that correspond to the three categories of local treatment comparison are shown in table 2 The differences in breast cancer mortality are greater at 15 years than at 5 years and the 15 year differences in breast cancer mortality in the three categories are approximately proportional to the differences in 5 year local recurrence risk The regression line through zero relating the absolute effects on local recurrence to those on breast cancer mortality suggests that a local treatment difference that reduces the 5 year local recurrence risk by 20 would reduce the 15 year breast cancer mortality by 5 2 SE 0 8 2pϽ0 00001 Breast cancer mortality 5 year risk active vs control

however not very sensitive to any real heterogeneity that might exist A more relevant observation is that in 3 quite different circumstances the avoidance of local recurrence mainly during the ﬁrst 5

fairly reliable as the effects of local treatment on local recurrence can be so extreme subgroup speciﬁc results for breast cancer mortality might well not be Hence unduly selective emphasis on particularly favourable or unfavourable mortality results from particular subgroups or particular trials or even from particular types of treatment comparison could give rise to misleading over estimation or under estimation of the real relevance of local disease control to long term breast cancer mortality Instead the most reliable estimate of the effect on breast cancer mortality of a particular local treatment comparison in particular subgroups of women might come not from the apparent results for breast cancer mortality in those subgroups but from estimating the effect of that treatment comparison on local recurrence risk in those subgroups and then applying the general ﬁnding that a 20 absolute reduction in 5 year local recurrence risk leads to about a 5 absolute reduction in 15 year breast cancer mortality ie a four to one ratio of absolute effects women allocated radiotherapy that mainly involved contralateral breast cancer 2p 0 002 and lung cancer 2p 0 0007 and there was an excess mortality from causes other than breast cancer that mainly involved heart disease 2p 0 0001 and lung cancer 2p 0 0004 Based on much smaller numbers there was also a moderately signiﬁcant excess mortality from pulmonary embolism and excess incidence of oesophagus cancer leukaemia and soft tissue sarcoma The effects of these radiotherapy regimens on contralateral breast cancer and on mortality from causes other than breast cancer are plotted against time since randomisation in webﬁgure 7 The averaged effects on 15 year outcome are not large 9 3 vs 7 5 for contralateral breast cancer 15 9 vs 14 6 for nonbreast cancer mortality but they may well vary substantially from one regimen to another and the absolute 15 year mortality differences could also depend strongly on tumour laterality which can affect cardiac radiation dose smoking habits which affect both vascular and lung cancer risks other vascular risk factors and particularly on age The excess of contralateral breast cancer with radiotherapy appears mainly during the period 5 14 years after randomisation table 4 webﬁgure 7 and is signiﬁcant even among women aged 50 years or older when randomised table 4 When the excess mortality from causes other than breast cancer is subdivided by time since randomisation the proportional excess again appears to be less during the ﬁrst 5 years than in subsequent years but it is separately signiﬁcant for the periods 5 14 years and 15 years or more after randomisation The mean dates of randomisation for those who died 5 14 years and 15 years or more after randomisation were however 1975 and 1970 respectively and the radiotherapy regimens of the early 1970s may well have involved greater hazards than many current regimens The excess mortality from causes other than breast cancer is signiﬁcant both for women younger than 50 years of age and for women older than 50 years of age when randomised 2p 0 02 for both but the CIs for the age speciﬁc risks are wide The numbers are not sufﬁcient for the main hazards contralateral breast cancer lung cancer or heart disease to be reliably subdivided by both follow up duration and age Results of

mortality although still signiﬁcant is only 3 5 72 3 vs 68 8 indicating a continuing excess of non breast cancer mortality long after treatment with the older radiotherapy regimens Discussion Main ﬁndings About three quarters of the local recurrence risk and more than three quarters of any treatment effects on local recurrence occurred during the ﬁrst 5 years after randomisation By contrast more than half the 15 year breast cancer mortality and much more than half of any such treatment effects on breast cancer mortality occurred after the ﬁrst 5 years Some local treatment comparisons eg axillary clearance vs effective axillary radiotherapy mastectomy vs BCS plus effective radiotherapy post mastectomy radiotherapy in nodenegative disease involved little Ͻ10 absolute difference in the 5 year risk of local recurrence and in aggregate these comparisons also involved little difference in 15 year breast cancer mortality ﬁgure 5 upper panel Local recurrence and breast cancer mortality The other local treatment comparisons are those that involved absolute differences of more than 10 in the 5 year risk of local recurrence eg post BCS radiotherapy mainly to the conserved breast post mastectomy radiotherapy in node positive disease conservation of the breast or axilla without effective radiotherapy to the conserved tissue In the aggregate of all such comparisons involving a total of 25 000 women the 5 year local recurrence risks were 7 active versus 26 control reduction 19 and the 15 year breast cancer mortality risks were 44 6 versus 49 5 reduction 5 0 SE 0 8 2pϽ0 00001 Treatment comparisons that produced similar sized effects on local recurrence tended to produce similar sized effects on breast cancer mortality webﬁgure 5 In particular both for the 7300 women in trials of post BCS radiotherapy mostly with axillary clearance and pathologically node negative disease and for the 8500 women in trials of post mastectomy radiotherapy after axillary clearance in node positive disease the absolute reductions in 5 year local recurrence and in 15 year breast cancer mortality were similar in magnitude to those in the aggregated results in all 25 000 women and were highly signiﬁcant This ﬁnding indicates that the avoidance of recurrence in a www thelancet com Vol 366 December 17 24 31 2005 conserved breast and the avoidance of other local recurrence eg in the chest wall or regional lymph nodes are of comparable relevance to 15 year breast cancer mortality In these two particular radiotherapy comparisons as in the aggregated results differences in local treatment that substantially affect locoregional recurrence would in the hypothetical absence of other causes of death avoid about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years for every four such recurrences avoided Moreover even when it does not affect survival avoiding a local recurrence can be of substantial beneﬁt Non breast cancer mortality and overall mortality The absence of other causes of death is of course not a realistic assumption particularly for older patients Even the general mortality that is not caused by breast cancer or its treatment makes the 15 year survival gain somewhat smaller for overall mortality than for breast cancer mortality as it reduces by a similar factor the proportion of 15 year survivors in both the treatment group and the control group Moreover most of the substantial differences in local recurrence in these trials were produced by radiotherapy and some of the radiotherapy regimens at least in the older trials of post mastectomy radiotherapy appreciably increased mortality more than 5 years later from diseases other than breast cancer with most of this excess mortality involving heart disease and lung cancer In addition this overview conﬁrms the previous evidence26 27 that radiotherapy can increase the incidence of contralateral breast cancer more than 5 years later which would slightly reduce its net beneﬁcial effect on 15 year breast cancer mortality We cannot ascertain from the present data whether therapeutic doses of radiation affect the incidence of new ipsilateral breast cancer in a conserved breast as new and recurrent tumours are not separated Nevertheless at least in the post BCS radiotherapy trials and among women with axillary clearance and node positive disease in the postmastectomy radiotherapy trials the radiotherapy regimens that were tested produced moderate but deﬁnite reductions not only in 15 year breast cancer mortality but also in 15 year overall mortality ﬁgure 6 Further effects after year 15 The evidence as to what will happen after year 15 is still limited Thus far these trials have shown that the treatments that substantially reduced the 5 year local recurrence risk moderately reduced 15 year breast cancer mortality and 15 year overall mortality They also suggest that there will be little additional gain or loss after year 15 in breast cancer mortality ratio treatment vs control of annual breast cancer death rates during the period after year 15 1 03 SE 0 08 webﬁgure 3b There is however evidence from the aggregate of all radiotherapy trials of a somewhat higher death rate during the period after year 15 from causes other than breast cancer ratio radiotherapy vs not of annual non breast cancer death rates 2101 Articles after year 15 1 17 SE 0 06 but the mean date of randomisation for those dying in this late period was 1970 and the late hazards could well be substantially lower for modern radiotherapy regimens than for those of the 1960s and 1970s Breast cancer mortality rates remain substantial throughout at least the second decade after diagnosis and perhaps beyond as does the incidence of contralateral breast cancer while lung cancer and heart disease rates increase with advancing age If long term follow up of many of these trials is continued to 20 or more years or even to 30 or more years distinguishing between different causes of death and to the extent possible between new and recurrent tumours in a conserved breast the ensuing data will clarify substantially the long term risks and beneﬁts of the post BCS radiotherapy regimens in these trials as three quarters of the women were still alive in the present analyses table 1 It will also help clarify substantially the beneﬁts and risks of both the older and the more recent postmastectomy radiotherapy regimens in these trials Low and high local recurrence risks Radiotherapy produces its greatest absolute effects on local recurrence in women who are at greatest risk of local recurrence table 3 ﬁgures 2 and 3 For whether the underlying risk is low or high about 70 of it can be avoided by radiotherapy In the trials of post BCS radiotherapy the risk of local recurrence among controls depended strongly on nodal status 5 year risks 23 node negative 41 node positive and among those with node negative disease young age poor tumour differentiation and large tumour size all indicated a high local recurrence risk table 3 The large majority 78 of the node negative tumours in the post BCS radiotherapy trials were small 1 20 mm in their longest diameter but even with such small tumours without radiotherapy the 5 year risk of local recurrence was 20 table 3 In the trials of radiotherapy after mastectomy and axillary clearance the 5 year risk of local recurrence among the controls depended strongly on the number of involved nodes where this information was available risks 6 16 and 26 respectively for 0 1 3 and 4 involved nodes Among women with mastectomy axillary clearance and node negative disease the absolute reduction in 5 year local recurrence risk after radiotherapy was only 4 2 vs 6 so if one death from the original breast cancer is avoided for every four local recurrences avoided then the expected reduction in 15 year breast cancer mortality after radiotherapy would be only 1 less the adverse effects of any increase in contralateral disease Relatively few such women were randomised however and among them the apparent effect of radiotherapy on breast cancer mortality happened to be slightly unfavourable Only where the absolute effects of radiotherapy on local recurrence are substantial can they be used to help 2102 quantify any proportional relationship between effects on local control and on breast cancer mortality Among all women with mastectomy axillary clearance and node positive disease the absolute effects of radiotherapy on the 5 year local recurrence risk were substantial 6 vs 23 particularly if the tumour was poorly differentiated or large and breast cancer mortality was correspondingly reduced In these postmastectomy trials however age was of little or no relevance to local recurrence mainly in the nodes or chest wall even though in the post BCS trials age was of substantial relevance to local recurrence mainly in the conserved breast table 3 Generalisability of ﬁndings Changes in practice There have been and will continue to be substantial changes in the use or methods of screening surgery pathology radiotherapy and systemic adjuvant therapy since many of these trials began 28 30 In particular tumour sizes are generally smaller systemic therapy is more effective radiotherapy is less likely to be given to the internal mammary chain of lymph nodes or to a surgically cleared axilla and there has been increasing recognition of the late side effects of radiotherapy and of the need when treating early breast cancer to limit doses to the heart and lungs Hence depending mainly on the doses to the heart lungs and contralateral breast the late hazards of current and future radiotherapy regimens might well be much lower than those of the regimens studied in the older trials Moreover advances in early diagnosis surgery and systemic therapy mean that the 5 year risks of local recurrence might well be much less than in these trials Nevertheless some risk is likely to remain since the desire to control local recurrence after either BCS or mastectomy has to be balanced not only against the late adverse effects but also against the cosmetic and functional effects of excessive local treatment Prediction of absolute risks and beneﬁts Prediction from these trials of the long term risks of current radiotherapy regimens will depend on approximate comparison of current and previous radiation doses to the heart lungs etc while prediction of the eventual effects on breast cancer mortality will depend on what the local recurrence risks would currently be without radiotherapy The absolute risks of local recurrence in these trials and the absolute beneﬁts and hazards of radiotherapy in these trials cannot be generalised because of the continuing changes in practice since the trials began Nevertheless the quantitative relationship in these trials between local disease control and 15 year breast cancer mortality should still be relevant to current and future treatment decisions Where it is possible to estimate the absolute risk of a particular type of local recurrence after www thelancet com Vol 366 December 17 24 31 2005 Articles a particular type of surgery it is also possible to estimate the absolute reduction in this risk that effective radiotherapy would achieve as radiotherapy avoids about 70 of the risk of recurrence in the irradiated sites or that would have been avoided by more extensive surgery as surgery eliminates the possibility of recurrence in the excised tissue From the absolute reduction in local recurrence the absolute reduction in breast cancer mortality can be inferred For example if additional local treatment led to an estimated reduction in the 5 year local recurrence risk of say about 12 then from the general four to one relationship between effects on local recurrence and on breast cancer mortality it could reasonably reliably be inferred that the 15 year reduction in breast cancer mortality would be about 3 even though directly randomised proof of such a small mortality difference would be difﬁcult to obtain Combination of effects of local and systemic therapy Likewise as the risk of recurrence in a conserved breast is about twice as great in younger as in older women it could reasonably reliably be inferred that radiotherapy to a conserved breast or in the absence of radiotherapy mastectomy rather than BCS would have a correspondingly greater effect on breast cancer mortality in younger than in older women even though the age speciﬁc subgroup analyses of mortality have wide conﬁdence intervals webﬁgure 6a Furthermore avoidance of death from breast cancer gains more additional years of life expectancy for younger than for older women Systemic therapy can approximately halve the 5 year risks of both local and distant recurrence 20 In the absence of radiotherapy the risk of local recurrence although reduced by surgery and systemic therapy may still be substantial If it is then addition of radiotherapy or in some cases more extensive surgery would further reduce it by a substantial amount and thereby further reduce 15 year breast cancer mortality by a moderate amount 10 12 31 32 Indeed webﬁgure 6c suggests that the relationship between local control and breast cancer mortality is much the same with or without systemic therapy This conclusion may be of general validity even though it is based on the methods of local control and types of systemic therapy studied in these particular trials If so the moderate differences in 15 year breast cancer mortality produced by better local control can be combined with the moderate differences produced by chemotherapy and hormonal therapy and probably by newer systemic therapies yielding in total quite substantial effects on 15 year breast cancer mortality Hence although for the addition of radiotherapy or for other ways of improving local control the effects on breast cancer mortality are only moderate several such moderate reductions in mortality from earlier diagnosis from improvements in local control from the introduction of systemic therapy and from progressive changes www thelancet com Vol 366 December 17 24 31 2005 in its efﬁcacy may in combination approximately halve a middle aged patient s 15 year risk of death from breast cancer In some countries the introduction of several such improvements in diagnosis or treatment has in aggregate already led to substantial reductions since 1990 in the national breast cancer mortality rates in middle age 20 Conclusion The main purpose of the present overview is to help predict the effects of different treatment strategies on long term survival It makes no treatment recommendations nor does it assess the costs or the functional cosmetic or psychological effects of different treatments In early breast cancer local treatments that substantially improve local control have little effect on breast cancer mortality during the ﬁrst few years but have deﬁnite although moderate effects by 15 years and avoidance of local recurrence in a conserved breast and elsewhere are of comparable relevance to 15 year breast cancer mortality These trials of radiotherapy and of the extent of surgery show that in the hypothetical absence of other causes of death about one breast cancer death over the next 15 years would be avoided for every four local recurrences avoided Although the management of early breast cancer continues to change it is reasonable to assume that this approximate four to one relationship will continue to apply and will still be of relevance to future treatment choices Contributors The main contributors are the individuals or collaborative groups who undertook or are now continuing follow up of the trials that are reviewed
