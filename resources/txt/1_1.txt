surgery has long been a priority in clinical practice 1 2 This is reﬂected in the increase in breast conserving surgery following the 1990 Consensus Statement from the U S National Institutes of Health that equivalent survivals occur from early breast cancer irrespective of whether treated by mastectomy or breast conserving surgery and radiotherapy 3 Australian clinical practice guidelines for the management of early breast cancer released in 1995 and 2001 were consistent with this Statement and indicated the importance Corresponding author 4 Stonyfell Road Stonyfell South Australia

of women having a choice between breast conserving surgery and mastectomy 4 The U S Statement and associated trial evidence were followed by increases in breast conserving surgery rates in the U S Canada and some European countries 5e10 Australian data also showed a trend away from mastectomy towards breast conserving surgery both nationally and in some jurisdictions 11e17 Today around 60 of early breast cancers are treated by breast conserving surgery in Australia and the U S to improve cosmetic outcomes 7 17 Mastectomy is still the preferred surgical option for many early breast cancers including large cancers relative to breast size and cancers in difﬁcult locations where cosmetic outcomes would be difﬁcult to achieve with breast conservation 18 On other occasions patient choice is a determining factor because of fear of incomplete excision increased likelihood of multiple operations and concerns of an increase in risk of recurrence following breast conserving surgery 19 20 A number of studies have indicated that clinician choice may also be important 19e22 In a previous 0960 9776 e see front matter Ó 2013 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved http dx doi org 10 1016 j breast

found to be more common in women with large cancers those living in locations remote from major city centres and those treated by surgeons with low case volumes 23 North American data indicate that U S surgeons trained prior to the 1980s and male surgeons in particular were more likely to use mastectomy than breast conserving surgery 19 22 In addition access to specialists in breast reconstruction may be another important factor when women consider their surgical options 24 For women treated by mastectomy immediate or delayedimmediate breast reconstruction is often used to improve cosmetic outcomes 25 Innovations in surgical technique in the 1990s have led to skin sparing surgery that facilitated IBR 26 and reportedly had psychological beneﬁts for many women with a heightened fear of breast loss and disﬁgurement 27 28 In addition IBR with autogenous tissue transplantation rather than silicone implants became more common leading to more natural breast texture and potential psychological beneﬁts 27 28 Despite these advances IBR is still used for only a minority of mastectomy patients 17 24e29 One reason may be women s preferences to avoid major surgical procedures and concern that complications of IBR might delay adjuvant therapy Not being given the option of IBR and or a lack of available surgical expertise in smaller centres may be other reasons There may also be differences in demand by age and other sociodemographic characteristics and perhaps barriers from concerns that implants might compromise detection of local cancer recurrences and lead to poorer survival outcomes despite research evidence to the contrary 30e34 There is also concern that where post mastectomy radiotherapy is given for improved cancer control and survival this may detract from IBR healing and cosmetic outcomes 35e39 or that the IBR may impede radiotherapy effectiveness 36e38 Studies in some populations have found breast reconstruction rates to vary by geographic area of residence age of patient race income status and private health insurance status availability of breast reconstruction specialists general health status and tumour characteristics such as size nodal status number of tumour foci and whether the cancer is bilateral or unilateral 24 31 40 Availability of multidisciplinary team treatment planning is another factor that may affect reconstruction rates and coordination of reconstruction services In this study we investigate IBR rates following mastectomy for early invasive breast cancer in women treated by Australian breast surgeons participating in the Quality Audit 41 Although these cancers were not selected to be representative of all early breast cancers in Australia they comprise the majority and appear to be broadly representative in their survival outcomes 41e44 Also differences in survival from these cancers by conventional risk factors such as tumour size grade nodal status and oestrogen receptor status have accorded with differences observed in population based studies indicating that these data may be a credible basis for population inference 41 Research and health service implications of differences in IBR rates by sociodemographic and tumour characteristic are explored Methods Patients We analysed data for early invasive breast cancers treated by mastectomy by surgeons participating in the Quality Audit circa 1998e2010 DCIS cases were excluded The number of patients covered by the Audit has increased progressively and represents about 60 of women with early breast cancer in Australia 41e44 The Audit did not record residential postcode as part of its minimum data set throughout the study period We analyse data for 12 707 early invasive breast cancers diagnosed in Australian women and treated by mastectomy where residential postcodes were recorded This enabled analyses of IBR by remoteness and socio economic status of residential area which were factors of central interest 42 45 IBR was recorded for 958 invasive cases Statistical analysis Variables analysed as candidate predictors of IBR included all person provider cancer and treatment characteristics recorded on the database This breadth of analysis was undertaken because other studies indicated associations of a wide range of characteristics with breast reconstruction rates 24 31 40 Variables analysed included Age at

cancers diagnosed circa 1998e2010 An upward trend in IBR rate was evident with a peak of 9 applying for cases diagnosed in 2006e2010 Early preliminary data for 2011e2012 indicate a further rise in IBR rate to 12 This upward trend may reﬂect an increase in number of breast surgeons trained in both the oncological and breast reconstructive aspects of breast cancer management The IBR rate for the 1998e2010 study years ranged from 29 for women under 30 years to less than one per cent for those aged 80 years or more and showed an increase over time The overall 8 ﬁgure lies within the range that would apply in the U S U S SEER data aggregated for IBR plus reconstructions within the ﬁrst four months from mastectomy indicate rates ranging by state from 8 to 34 24 31 40 Other data for combined

England in 2006 26 48 49 International comparisons are complicated by variable inclusion of delayed reconstructions The American Society of Plastic Surgeons reported in 2003 that 60 of breast reconstructions performed by its members were not IBR with many occurring after the 4 month period covered by the SEER data 26 Another potential source of variation is differential inclusion of ductal carcinoma insitu DCIS lesions 31 These lesions were excluded from the present study which would have lowered the IBR rate note the Audit database indicates a more than 2 fold IBR rate for DCIS compared with early invasive cancer i e 19 Vs 8 Consistent with the SEER data IBR rates in this study were lower in older women those from lower socio economic areas and those without private insurance 26 29 31 38 Older women may be more accepting of loss of body form through mastectomy than younger women and less willing to have more major surgery which may lead to a lower demand for IBR Also they may have a higher prevalence of co morbidity of a magnitude that would contra indicate the longer and more complex operations for combined mastectomy and IBR Meanwhile women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and those without private insurance may have fewer IBR service options leading to a lower IBR Results from a previous study identiﬁed poorer access to breast reconstruction in the public sector and non metropolitan treatment centres which suggested a need to develop effective models for the rural sector address a lack of plastic surgeons reduce waiting times for reconstruction surgery in the public sector improve training in breast reconstruction and increase access to multidisciplinary team treatment planning 50 Asymptomatic women referred from BreastScreen and other sources had higher IBR rates after adjusting for tumour size nodal status and other clinical patient and service provider characteristics This may reﬂect differences in referral pathways with more asymptomatic women being referred to surgeons who perform IBR Meanwhile women attending surgeons in inner regional rather than major city centres were less likely to receive IBR This may be due to differences in service availability IBR was more common when surgeons had an annual case load of 11 rather than a lower case load This may relate to the availability of plastic and reconstructive surgeons to participate in a multidisciplinary team with breast surgeons Alternatively high volume breast surgeons may have had more training and experience in breast reconstructive and oncoplastic techniques simplifying the logistics of performing IBR As observed with SEER data lower IBR rates applied for more advanced disease as indicated by tumour size and nodal status 31 39 Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended for large tumours 50 mm and or in the presence of metastatic involvement of over three axillary lymph nodes 51 and has been shown to offer a survival advantage for invasive breast cancers with intermediate risk features for loco regional recurrence 52 53 Post mastectomy radiotherapy has been associated with signiﬁcant short and longterm complication rates for patients undergoing IBR using tissue expander implant methods 54 and with autogenous tissue methods including TRAM and DIEP ﬂaps 55 The results from a recent Australian study have indicated that the most common reason for not offering IBR is the anticipated need for postmastectomy radiotherapy for larger tumours with clinical axillary involvement 56 Other factors such as signiﬁcant medical comorbidities and smoking have also been associated with detrimental outcomes for IBR 57 It is likely that many surgeons take these issues into consideration when offering IBR for women undergoing mastectomy for invasive breast cancer 5 By comparison higher IBR rates applied for multifocal tumours those affecting more than one breast quadrant and synchronous bilateral breast cancers Although these cancers may be less amenable to breast conserving therapy they may still exhibit features that may not require post mastectomy radiotherapy e g small invasive cancer with an extensive DCIS component where mastectomy and IBR may be regarded as a reasonable option 23 The reason for the statistical association of IBR with ovarian ablation is not known and requires further investigation It is hypothesized that this may reﬂect concerns of many younger premenopausal women having IBR about body image and a preference to have ovarian ablation rather than adjuvant chemotherapy to avoid treatment side effects such as alopecia Meanwhile the suggested elevation in IBR rate for women who had a prior ipsilateral breast cancer treated by surgery although not quite statistically signiﬁcant in the multiple regression analysis relative odds 1 33 0 99 1 80 would be due to a history of earlier radiotherapy with their breast conserving surgery such that radiotherapy was not recommended again with their mastectomy for local recurrence Such cases without further radiotherapy would be good candidates for IBR Again this warrants further investigation together with the association of IBR with PR positive cancers which we suspect may have occurred by chance Data from the Quality Audit are important for describing the practices of specialist breast surgeons in Australia In addition other population based data should be collected to gain a more complete picture with provision for linkage of these data to cancer registries Conclusions IBR rates vary by socio demographic and provider characteristics Reasons for these differences including potential effects of variations in service access require further investigation In particular the reasons for low IBR rates for low case load surgeons and inner regional centres and for women from lower socioeconomic areas and those without private insurance raises questions about equity of access Additional population based data on breast reconstruction are needed to obtain a more complete picture with provision for linkage with cancer registry data Ethical approval Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the research ethics
