Chasing the Youth Vote Kevin07 Web 2 0 and the 2007 Australian Federal Election Dylan Kissane School of International Studies University of South Australia Paper presented at Politics Web 2 0 An International Conference Royal Holloway University of London 17 18 April 2008 Please do not cite without permission Introduction The 2007 Australian federal election was the first in which the online campaign and Web 2 0 technologies moved into the mainstream Though not the first election campaign where political parties had maintained an internet presence it was the first in which Facebook friends of party leaders were compared in the mainstream press the first where YouTube videos became election issues and the first where online interactions between parties and party supporters were reported as real and breaking news Amongst all of the online campaigning though it was the Australian Labor Party ALP that was widely recognised as presenting the best and most effective online presence With a site that embraced social networking tools hosted online video included regular blog posts from leading party figures and drew on user contributions for content the ALP s Kevin07 com au brought the election campaign to Australia s online community in a way that was without equal in this or any previous election The site widely held to be aimed at drawing young people to the ALP was judged an unqualified success in the wake of the ALP s historic November win where the party secured a significant majority of the youth vote The role of the Kevin07 com au site in drawing young people to the ALP is however open to debate Indeed when one considers pre election polling data it becomes clear that young voters had established firm voting intentions long before the ALP s online campaign was launched This paper is presented in four parts The first presents a review of the increasingly important role played by the online elements of an Australian federal election campaign Tracing an eleven year four election period from 1996 to 2007 this section traces the growing focus of political parties the mainstream media and voters on the online presence of campaigning parties The second part of this paper presents the ALP s Kevin07 com au site the centrepiece of the ALP s online campaign for young voters The third part of this paper offers evidence that contradicts the notion that the online campaign of the ALP was effective in winning young voters to their cause Specifically by considering opinion poll data from 2005 until the election in November 2007 it is clear that while there was a significant rise in support for the ALP amongst young people this rise occurred many months before the launch of the website and can be attributed to the party s change in leadership A discussion section follows and the paper concludes by suggesting that for a number of reasons the 2007 election was an anomaly in terms of the impact of the internet on the voting intentions of Australian youth and that future campaigning online may well have a measureable and significant effect in drawing young people to a political party 1996 to 2007 The Growing Significance of Campaign Websites in Australia The Australian election campaign of the twenty first century does in some ways still resemble the campaigns of the past As Sally Young has argued contrary to popular opinion there was never a golden age of electioneering where voters were targeted with densely worded factual tracts instead of the common fear inducing advertising of today 1 Indeed campaign elements such as negative campaign commercials comparing competitors with foreign dictators and the so called Presidential style campaign where a party leader becomes the focus of the campaign are nothing new at all in the Australian electoral experience 2 Yet one difference that has emerged in recent years is the embrace by Australian political parties of new communication technologies in particular internet technologies through which they 1 2 Sally Young 2003 A Century of Political Communication in Australia 1901 2001 Journal of Australian Studies 78 97 110 p 109 Young 2003 p 109 can campaign for the votes of 13 million Australians enrolled to vote 3 As in other electoral jurisdictions worldwide campaign websites have become essential elements of a modern electoral effort in Australia in the age of 24 hour cable news and enthusiastic bloggers and citizen journalists who demand immediate access to campaign material The first campaign websites in Australia emerged as a part of the 1996 federal election 4 Of the two major political parties in Australia the ALP was most proactive in embracing the internet as a campaign tool Reports Young The ALP s website received 11 000 hits a day during the 1996 campaign By 1998 all ALP policies were being released on the Internet simultaneously with their release to the media and the ALP website was providing games and online chats with local MPs 5 Rachel Gibson and Stephen Ward agree and point to the obvious enthusiasm for internet electioneering by the centreleft party in the mid 1990 s noting that in 1996 the ALP had already begun to use audio and interactive features on their Website as well as offering extensive policy information and negative campaigning against the Liberals 6 Not only was the ALP website drawing interested voters to Labor policy statements and media releases it was also playing a part in recruiting new members for the ALP 7 In a country where according to commentator George Megalogenis some 10 to 20 of Australians don t care about politics the ALP website was attracting five new financial members a day to the party proving a success not only in communicating policy but also driving activism 8 The 11 000 daily hits that the ALP received during the 1996 campaign would explode exponentially by the time the 1998 federal election took place Gibson and Ward report that the ALP site received over two million hits during the fiveweek campaign a remarkable achievement given the eleven million voters in the country 9 Moving beyond merely being a source of media releases and maintaining opportunities for infrequent online chats with MPs the 1998 federal election saw the ALP making a concerted effort to attract web savvy voters to the cause of leader Kim Beazley As Gibson and Ward note The site revealed a more concerted effort by the party to use the Internet to attract voters with multimedia games downloadable banners and e postcards an interactive tax reckoner video political commercials an updated campaign diary and Webcasting of key events such as the campaign launch in Brisbane not available in the traditional media 10 Despite losing the election to the Liberal National Coalition the success of the ALP s internet strategy was hailed as a major breakthrough in electioneering in Australia Bruce Hawker a prominent Labor strategist would remark that the 3 Peter Brent and Simon

and Ward 2002 pp 104 105 9 Gibson and Ward 2002 p 105 10 Gibson and Ward 2002 p 105 ALP s online effort had changed the face of Australian political campaigning 11 Hawker highlighted the points of difference that the website offered users as compared to mainstream campaigning in particular the online streaming video that allowed 100 000 users to watch the ALP campaign launch live and exclusively in the absence of a live free toair television broadcast 12 By the time of the 2001 federal election both major parties had invested significant resources into their campaign websites recognising that the internet was allowing them to interact with interested voters Specifically though the major parties recognised the opportunity that internet campaigning presented for targeting key electoral demographics in particular the young internet savvy voters who were beginning to shun old media As Gibson and Ward argue the youth vote was an explicit focus of both the ALP and Coalition election campaigns where a multimedia format appears to be highly attractive to young people 13 Learning from experiences in the UK and the US where young voters had been successfully targeted by Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore the Australian parties fiercely fought an online war for the votes of young people 14 However as Edgar Crook notes t hough there was much activity on the Internet it did not have a leading role in the election battle 15 Despite significant numbers of hits to party and campaign websites the impact of the online campaign was hard to quantify and may have been as Crook contends the online campaign played a minor role in determining the eventual electoral outcome 16 The 2004 election saw a further sustained focus paid by the major parties to online campaigning In 2006 Peter Chen Rachel Gibson and Karin Geiselhart reported that the online campaigns of the major parties were proving successful in connecting the parties with committed and active individuals 17 Australian voters who visited campaign websites were twice as likely to have a tertiary education 50 compared to 25 and be almost twice as interested in the election outcome as the average voter 56 compared to 30 18 Significantly however the individuals who visited party websites were also much more likely to already hold strong party identifications or as Chen Gibson and Geiselhart put it the parties are preaching to the converted if not members specifically 19 Whatever the audience of the campaign websites the online presence of Australian political parties became increasingly important for as Edgar Crook writes political parties lobby groups and official bodies such as the Australian electoral Commission were now using the Internet as the only or primary source for information on policies candidates and general voting information 20 11 Bruce Hawker 1999 Australia 1998 Internet Campaigning Makes a Spectacular Debut Netpulse 3 14 http tinyurl com 378el2

and Geiselhart 2006 p 24 20 Crook 2007 p 1 Thus from 1996 where the ALP celebrated 11 000 daily hits to 2004 where the internet had become for some parties the only source for policy documents and party information the internet has moved from being an ignorable election sideshow to a key part of every federal election campaign and this trend would continue in 2007 Crook argues i t is clear now that the 2007 federal election can safely be adjudged as the first in which the Internet became not just the repository for information but also a tool both to communicate policies with the public and to allow potential voters to in return interact in multiple ways with the parties and their candidates 21 The interaction between candidates parties and voters led some commentators to label the 2007 federal poll the first Web 2 0 election As candidates embraced technologies and web services such as blogs YouTube Facebook MySpace and user driven campaign content the online campaigns of the major parties and major lobby groups became mainstream news Writing in the country s only national newspaper The Australian Anne Parsons remarks on the success of the leftist lobby group GetUp org au in drawing their issues to the attention of politicians and voters via online petition drives and fundraising for issue advertisements 22 A stomach turning YouTube video of the ALP Leader Kevin Rudd eating his own ear wax in the federal parliament was widely reported on television and in newspapers across the country and internationally the Herald Sun reporting that the video was replayed on Jay Leno s Tonight Show and linked on the influential Drudge Report 23 The online and mainstream print media eagerly tracked the number of Facebook and MySpace friends that party leaders maintained and parties engaged online voters with exclusive internetonly campaign events 24 The Web 2 0 election had certainly arrived and it was the Australian Labor Party that led the political field in seeking votes through the engagement of Australia s online electorate The Kevin07 Online Campaign Chasing the Youth Vote Of the two major Australian political parties it was the ALP that garnered the most attention to its online campaign so much so that the branding of the site and its URL quickly entered the Australian lexicon 25 Whereas the campaign launches of the major parties in Australia tend to take place some weeks into the official campaign period immediately before the election the ALP s Kevin07 com au site was launched months before the November 24th poll Indeed it was 21 Crook 2007 p 2

2008 7 22 launched before the election date was even announced 26 The central website brought together all of the other online elements of the ALP campaign with particular focus given to the Web 2 0 elements of both the ALP and Kevin Rudd s new technologies approach The site not only offered a video channel through YouTube and links to popular social networking sites MySpace and Facebook but also a campaign blog which in a move that remains atypical for major political parties allowed the public to respond to blog posts with comments critical of the party 27 Visitors to the site could also purchase branded merchandise including bumper stickers and t shirts and sign up for K Mail which would allow the user to receive regular ALP campaign updates The launch of the central Kevin07 com au site was met with great media interest and all major newspapers in Australia reported the launch of the web presence 28 In almost all cases the MSM coverage was positive with reporters and columnists commonly comparing the ALP online strategy to a relatively non existent Coalition strategy 29 In the blogosphere however the reaction was more mixed Left leaning bloggers at Larvatus Prodeo larvatusprodeo net welcomed the ALP s strategy Kevin07 does what the Coalition isn t really doing engaging with the mostly young users of social media It s a cleverly designed one stop site for the Kevin07 presence on YouTube MySpace and Facebook And as Trevor Cook suggested it s a first for Australian Politics 2 0 in actually allowing unfiltered comment on the Kevin07 blog there s criticism there as well as Young Labor adulation That s actually very clever 30 Other left leaning bloggers were less impressed arleesher from group blog Stoush reacted to receiving her first piece of K Mail by posting despite my general love of pop culture hottness sic this actually makes me less likely to vote for Rudd 31 Elsewhere in the Australian blogosphere some concluded the newly launched site would be of great benefit to the ALP in the coming campaign particularly in comparison to the relatively weak online campaigning of the Coalition parties At ElectionTracker one commenter noted This effort to get in touch with young people through things such as www kevin07 com au may be seen as just playing YouTube politics to get votes But hey at least he Rudd is trying to get in touch with young people Howards sic been in government for 11 yrs and only when it looks like his government is going down does he attempt to get connected But he has no idea and gives boring and out of touch speeches to young people via You Tube That only continues young people s uninspired relationship with the Coalition government 32 While some commentators saw the Kevin07 com au campaign as too presidential and too American the online campaign was closely followed and widely reported upon during the long 2007 Federal campaign 26 The election date was announced by Prime Minister John Howard on 14 October 2007 The Kevin07 site was launched on 6 August 2007 27 See an example of a critical comment published on the Kevin07 com au blog at Trevor Cook 2007 Kevin07 publishes criticism Trevor Cook 11 January 2008

ElectionTracker 11 January 2008 http tinyurl com 2j6k7d All commentators were in agreement however as to the electoral demographic that the ALP was targeting with the Kevin07 com au strategy The online push and particularly its focus on social networking and user generated content and commentary was aimed at young voters and most MSM sources noted the deliberate push by Rudd and the ALP to attract the youth vote The Australian the country s only national daily newspaper noted the obvious targets of the ALP s Web 2 0 strategy Labor has been courting the youth vote upping the web war for votes by launching the Kevin07 site where it explains its policies and provides a forum for debate Drawing on the format of MySpace Facebook and YouTube the site encourages viewers to contribute their own videos written and audio comments and to make links to their sites as part of the ALP campaign 33 Melbourne s Age newspaper also noted how the site quite deliberately reached out to young people BEFORE Kevin Rudd even got up to make his first speech of the election campaign yesterday the Kmails and text messages had gone out from Labor headquarters to Kevin s estimated 25 000 cybermates to remind young voters who weren t already enrolled to vote to sign up A digital clock was loaded onto the Kevin07 website to begin the countdown until 8pm Wednesday night when the electoral rolls close to those not already signed on 34 Catherine Deveny also writing in The Age also focussed on the ALP s push for the youth vote via the Kevin07 com au site In a column shortly after the launch of the Web 2 0 effort she wrote slightly tongue in cheek When I first heard about Kevin07 I thought it was something cooked up by the boys from The Chaser The Name s Rudd Kevin Rudd Agent 07 But log on to kevin07 com and you ll find that Kevin Rudd is so down with the youth he s practically an Emo It s all YouTube MySpace and Facebook You can even sign up to KMAIL 35 A specific link between Web 2 0 technologies the youth demographic and the ALP campaign was made by Jane Bunce who noted that Kevin Rudd s pitch to the YouTube generation was paying off 36 Brisbane s Courier Mail went so far as to profile one of the young people that the ALP s online campaign had successfully targeted noting that the online strategy of the party was unashamedly coveting the support of 2 million voters aged between 18 and 30 37 With ALP policies targeted specifically at winning over the youth vote and age specific advertising released as part of the Kevin07 com au campaign it appears likely that the Web 2 0 campaign had at its heart the aim of winning the young voters to the ALP cause 38 The Youth Vote at the 2007 Australian Federal Election Historically younger voters in Australia are significantly

23 favoured right leaning parties such as the Liberals the Nationals and Family First 39 Of the individual parties support amongst young people for the ALP outstrips support for the Liberal National Coalition by more than 2 to 1 see Figure 1 below 40 Figure 1 Party Support Amongst Young People 2007 41 Pre election polling suggested that this disparity was even greater in 2007 with one public poll concluding that 73 of voters under the age of 29 intended to vote for the ALP a result that was staggering in its implications according to one commentator 42 This massive swing in support amongst youth to the ALP far outweighing even the historic trend amongst young people to favour the political left has been attributed to many factors including the ALP branding of the campaign an impression that the time had come to replace a Prime Minister approaching 70 years of age with a younger person or simply a slightly exaggerated facsimile of the national swing in support to the ALP after more than a decade of Coalition government One factor it should not be attributed to however is the ALP s high profile Web 2 0 campaign Kevin07 com au may have gained the party headlines but it did nothing to draw younger voters to the party on the 24th of November 2007 Tracking Youth Voting Intentions 2004 2007 A clear change in the voting intentions of young people can be seen when voting intentions are tracked via public polling results As shown in Figure 2 overleaf however this spike in support for the ALP occurred some 8 months before the ALP launched its Web 2 0 campaign and further the launch of the Kevin07 com au site did nothing to encourage any more young voters to pledge support to the ALP or its leader 39 Natasha Stott Despoja 2007 Federal Election Youth Poll Results 13 March

tinyurl com 38lpp5 40 Figure 2 Proportion of Voters Aged 18 34 Years Favouring ALP Jan 2005 Oct 2007 43 The jump in support for the ALP between the October 2006 quarter and the January 2007 quarter can be attributed to the ALP s decision on the 4th of December 2006 to replace leader Kim Beazley with Kevin Rudd This conclusion is supported when the same January 2005 October 2007 period is considered for another Newspoll question as to a voters preferred Prime Minister Figure 3 below Figure 3 Proportion of Voters Aged 18 34 Years Preferring an ALP Prime Minister Quite clearly the proportion of young voters who intended to vote for the ALP rose immediately as a result of Kevin Rudd s accession to the Labor Party leadership Indeed young voters reported that their preference for the ALP leader as PM rose from an average of 28 3 across the last three quarters of 2006 under Beazley to an average of 52 6 across the first three quarters of 2007 under Rudd 43 Data for Figures 2 3 and 4 is extracted from public opinion polling conducted by Newspoll and available at www newspoll com au Significantly though the level of youth support that flowed to the ALP as a result of the leadership change was maintained in the 11 months until the election As depicted in Figure 4 below the support for the ALP by young people remained around the 50 mark from January 2007 until November 2007 barely fluctuating with the launch of the Kevin07 com au website in August Figure 4 Prefer ALP Prime Minister 18 34 Year Olds 2005 2007 Blue bars indicate Beazley leadership red bars Rudd leadership and green bars periods in which the Kevin07 campaign was active As is clearly shown neither the Presidential style focus of the ALP campaign on leader Kevin Rudd and the branding of the Web 2 0 campaign at Kevin07 com au had any significant effect on the electoral preferences of young voters Indeed Figure 4 suggests that the most effective electoral strategy employed by the ALP in attracting young voters was the replacement of one leader with another Discussion Such conclusions stand somewhat in opposition to other research into the efficacy of campaign websites in attracting support and converting voters to the campaigns cause As Rachel Gibson Ian McAllister Clive Bean and David Gow argued in a paper on cyber campaigning in Australia the impact of the internet on the public is usually more significant Our results reveal strong support for the proposition that a web campaign is an integral part of securing victory in an election Net of a wide variety of other factors including incumbency party affiliation and political experience and support the use of a web page delivers just under 4 percent of the House of Representatives first preference vote This is more than all of the traditional methods of campaigning combined and is only slightly less than incumbency usually considered one of the major electoral influences The web is then a major vote attractor for candidates and has the potential in closely fought contests to determine the election outcome 44 Far from an integral part of securing the youth vote the Kevin07 com au Web 2 0 campaign had no significant effect on drawing young voters to the ALP It seems possible that the particular circumstances of the 2007 Federal election played some part in the impotence of the ALP s online campaign for youth votes With the ruling Liberal National Coalition having held power for more than a decade and with Prime Minister Howard having held his position for all of that time there was a generation of voters born after 1978 that has never known an election as a voter where Howard and the Coalition did not win 45 As a result some commentators speculate that the young voters of Australia were simply ready for a change George Megalogenis writing in The Australian noted that a month before the election the swing of youth voters to the ALP was paradoxical The group that has swung most decisively to Kevin Rudd are the 18 24 year olds The Coalition Government s primary vote was up 5 4 per cent on the 2004 election Against former ALP leader Kim Beazley John Howard was seen as groovy No wonder the Prime Minister thought he had a fifth victory in him Then Labor changed leaders last December and the country went to Kevin By the end of June this year Rudd was pulling a gen Y swing of 19 4 per cent leaving Labor 14 per cent ahead of where it had been with this tribe at the 2004 election It is the youth belt where the paradox of Howard s near full employment economy is most apparent The 18 24s have never known recession 46 The paradox being that young people who had never known a recession had every likelihood of gaining employment in their field without problems be more highly educated and earn more in real terms than any other generation yet choose to endorse an untested leader for his new and fresh leader was noted by other commentators too Just two weeks before the election Dennis Shanahan noted polling that suggested that 51 of Australians considered the Coalition better economic managers compared to 32 for the ALP 84 of Australians considered John Howard a strong leader and that the Coalition leader outpaced the ALP challenger almost two to one in terms of experience and yet still favoured the accepted weaker economic managers and less strong and experienced Opposition over the incumbent 47 With economic management historically one of the most significance factors in deciding the vote of the Australian electorate the paradox Megalogenis and Shanahan point to might suggest that this election was an anomaly as far as the youth of the country are concerned As well it might also be the case that the young voters who clicked their way to the Kevin07 com au site were likely already committed ALP voters Besides the fact that more than half of young voters had committed to the ALP before the launch of the website in August 2007 previous research into online campaigning in Australia has suggested that it is active and already committed voters that are most likely to access campaign websites of their favoured parties 48 44 Rachel

campaign was a non campaign YouTube video of ALP leader Kevin Rudd eating his own ear wax garnering more than 900 000 views or approximately 1 view for every 15 enrolled voters there is scope to suspect that the Web 2 0 campaign did little to influence the electoral preferences of young Australian voters Essentially the popularity of the ALP site may have been the result of the young people who switched allegiances to the ALP in early 2007 rather than the site drawing young voters to the ALP via an interactive Web 2 0 approach Conclusion The 2007 Federal election campaign was the first truly internet era campaign and as well the first online campaign where Web 2 0 technologies were an integral part of the campaign The ALP site Kevin07 com au was by far the leading campaign site in the 2007 election cycle drawing more attention more media reports more hits and its URL quickly entering the wider Australian lexicon Aimed at drawing young voters to the ALP the site was lauded in the mainstream press and by the Australian online community as a new and welcome element in modern Australian electoral battles In the final analysis the youth of Australia did swing to the ALP in massive numbers and the Labor Party gathered in excess of 70 of the two party preferred vote amongst 18 29 year old voters Yet as polling data suggests the launch and success of the Kevin07 com au campaign had nothing to do with this historic support Instead the young people of Australia had established their preference for a revitalised ALP under the new leadership of Kevin Rudd as early as January 2007 seven months before the website was launched and 10 months before the election date was announced This paper has suggested that the reason that the Kevin07 com au campaign website played no part in drawing youth support to the ALP in the manner it would be expected to based on previous federal polls is related to the specific circumstances of the 2007 election A government that was incumbent for more than a decade a Prime Minister that was perceived as too old and too conservative for a younger generation all a large group of voters who being born after 1978 had never known an election as a voter where the Coalition had not triumphed all contributed to a feeling of it s time among young people who voted the government out in spite of not because of the Web 2 0 efforts of the Australian Labor Party For all the millions of dollars that the ALP spent on online advertising managing the Kevin07 com au site promoting the Kevin07 brand and reaching out to young voters the single most important step that the ALP took to securing the votes of young people was dumping the experienced but unpopular Kim Beazley in favour of the younger less experienced morning TV regular Kevin Rudd Kevin Rudd may have captured more youth votes than any Opposition Leader in a generation at the November poll but the vote that delivered them took place nearly twelve months before behind closed doors in the ALP party room Appendix A Screenshots of the Kevin07 com au site Homepage of Kevin07 com au on 7 August 2007 launch of site http pandora nla gov au pan 75521 20070807 1702 www
