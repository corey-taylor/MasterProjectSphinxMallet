Torytube ca and the Ontario 2007 Election The Web 2 0 Politics of Embedded Political Video By Zachary P Devereaux PhD Candidate Ryerson University Toronto www infoscapelab ca Acknowledgements This research has been Funded in Part by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada a Grant from the Canadian Media Research Consortium and the Robarts Centre for Canadian Studies and a Grant from the International Office Ryerson University Abstract The claim that traditional political participation has been steadily declining Wilkins 2000 needs to be re evaluated in light of the rise of Internet related means of social engagement Ian Angus holds that democratic spaces including new web spaces are central to the health of a democracy Angus 2001 What are the democratic spaces and practices enabled by Web 2 0 in the context of Canadian political culture How if at all has the recent proliferation of new media technology and techniques changed the nature of political agency and participation in Canadian politics In particular how do Canadian political leaders and established parties use Web 2 0 This paper uses cases from the recent provincial election in Ontario to explore how Canadian politicians structure public participation and political processes Canadian politicians have recently engaged in Web 2 0 politics with videos and social networking sites to lampoon opponents and recruit supporters These constructions shape the agency of the user and the public within their informational political campaigns The paper examines the role of money publicity video satire surveillance and recruitment into overtly political associations on an Ontario Liberal video satire site called Torytube ca Politicians chose in this election to use the Internet as a back room for more controversial and viral campaigning a strategy that allowed them to disavow dirty tactics in the mainstream media Theoretically this paper compares the case of the Ontario Election to Philip N Howard s notion of thin citizenship and Wendy Chun s notion of software as ideology How do the Web 2 0 developments of the recent Ontario election indicate the promotion of thin citizenship and appeal to default ideologies in Web practice 2 Why associate myself with Reverend Wright in the first place they may ask Why not join another church And I confess that if all that I knew of Reverend Wright were the snippets of those sermons that have run in an endless loop on the television and You Tube or if Trinity United Church of Christ conformed to the caricatures being peddled by some commentators there is no doubt that I would react in much the same way But the truth is that isn t all that I know of the man Barak Obama A More Perfect Union speech addressing controversial video clips of his Reverend my italics 1 Television and Youtube mentioned by Barak Obama during damage control in the same breath side by side this is the nature of Web 2 0 politics I Dingpolitik without the Ding and Politics of Transcription Making Things Public Atmospheres of Democracy2 gives us a few excellent starting points from whence to evaluate the nature of political video in Ontario s 2007 election Images have come a long way from the first photographs of Britain s parliament by Sir Benjamin Stone and yet the charged nature of political video evokes the memory of a threatening technology one of significant portent for making things public in democracy Edwards James 2005 There can be no doubt that since the time of the closed satellite and broadcast envelope of Bush Sr vs Clinton Springer 2005 some new space has opened up the public is now the producer and the satellite feed is bypassed by the handheld device Just as reality TV transformed broadcast television so too has the political video been transformed by embedded digital video 2 0 But one striking question may adhere to our inquiry into political videos online during the Ontario 2007 election namely what is Dingpolitik in relation to democracy when there is no Ding I 1 I gratefully acknowledge CBC parliament hill journalist James Cudmore for pointing out this moment http www huffingtonpost com 2008 03 18 obama race speech read t_n_92077 html 2 Making Things Public was a major art exhibition and an edited volume by the same name curated by Bruno Latour and Peter Weibel that was housed as the ZKM Karlsruhe I helped to build a Civil Society Issue Index that was displayed at the show www infoid org 3 am not trying to be disingenuous rather I am trying seriously to give credit to the fact that digital video has become a reality of political partisanship today and that as such digital videos are prototypical of Web 2 0 politics they are ephemeral hence the no Ding they are widely distributed they are user driven and they are perhaps even more partisan and controversial than the traditional video politics we are accustomed to and finally they are often done on the cheap In the same collection L Mondada examines the way a public at a speech comes into being and the way this constitution of an audience is portrayed by media Audio or video recordings of these events provide the possibility of understanding the interactional organization of collective action as it is done in a local emergent contingent way through the lively details participants use as resources for coordinating their conduct Mondada 2005 876 I agree with Mondada s analysis and this articulation holds true for the video recordings examined in this essay The digital dissemination of transcripts audio and video recordings amount to a virtual public in action and a digital extension of political speech This is an important part of the phenomenon of web 2 0 video The goal of a political video circulated via web 2 0 techniques is to relay a message and gather support however the critical difference from a traditional political speech is the distributed nature of the audience and the individual control of when a video will be viewed and to some extent what else will be done with it In web 2 0 video politics there is an interesting tendency towards chaos and there are two main themes I will explore to elucidate this new politics 2 0 strategy the digital political video as issue object and borrowing from Mondada the politics of transcription that she describes in the case of textual transcription of political speeches but that is also in play in the code transcription of videos as well as politics 2 0 strategizing To explore these themes I will variously evaluate the technologies practices and discourses making up the environment of video politics in the Ontario election of 2007 The findings of this research come in particular from examining the overlap between these three fields technology practices discourses when it comes to political videos online 4 Figure 1 Three overlapping fields of Politics 2 0 II The embedded video as issue object What is the object of video politics in an electoral campaign in the age of web 2 0 Based on our research into the Ontario election of 2007 I argue that the basic element is the digital video online It constitutes a most interesting dingpolitik with an ephemeral thing and a surplus of politics These videos may be mainly understood as issue objects circulating and being viewed within what Foucault calls a milieu of circulation in 5 particular the milieu of circulation established by web 2 0 platforms Foucault 2007 Given the option to produce such videos in the online environment what does one do It is not network or cable TV it is rather an environment marked by both stratification and a degree of chaos on account of the vertical and yet participatory nature of web 2 0 platforms What are the flows that accrue to these issue objects Who are the proponents who are the producers and who are the viewers What are the platforms and practices that mark the organization of political videos And last but not least what are the discourses that result from this interaction of technology and practice These are the questions I will briefly attempt to answer through an examination of political videos from the Ontario 2007 provincial election in Canada First of all what is the digital video as a thing or ding and why is it an issue object To answer this we need to start with the basic building block that is at the centre of this research project the digital video online The digital video as an issue object is a type of atom It is a software format combined with a Web 2 0 business code model It is a nonhuman in a network It is reproducible and ephemeral The key quality is its digitality and its transportability The key decision for issue objects of this type is To share or Not to share I argue that this decision takes place within the triangulation of technology practice and discourse that constitutes what I call politics 2 0 or how to do politics with and through web 2 0 media and techniques Embedded video code sample for John Tory tries to speak French por favor 6 object width 425 height 355 param name movie value http www youtube com v PaVou_LTK3Q hl en para m param

reaching the top of the returns for a search string e g opponent s name then the chances are high that other videos from the same source will be recommended by Youtube However the important thing is that the video can be embedded into any HTML markup website or blog In this way we see that both through the transcription of the embed code and the application of a referral system the aggregator influences the creation of meaning within the actor network Latour 2005 Langlois 2006 Tapping into these networks is key for political video campaigns III Methodology Search terms John Tory Dalton

Official e g Premierofontario vs Unofficial e g Premierpinocchio sources Aggregators But perhaps most indicative of web 2 0 and arguably most interesting was the embed this video code discussed above that allows a user to lift a video from its source location reproducing it elsewhere It is important to note in this aspect that examining political video requires us to enter into software studies Embedded video code is dependent upon how the video object is transcribed into the code environment As such it is an example of what Adrian Mackenzie calls practical virtuality a trancoding articulation of video politics into the Web 2 0 arena Mackenzie 2006 As we shall see this virtual articulation shapes the possibilities for campaign politics and can be managed more or less well by political actors 9 IV Modes of officialdom Code Structure of Torytube ca and NDP4Tory ca On Youtube where this video contest was primarily fought two official accounts serve the largest parties The account JohnTory2007 represents officially the Progressive Conservative party with 60 videos Premier of Ontario is an official account of Dalton McGuinty leader of the governing Liberals and houses 37 videos The Premier of Ontario account is additionally linked to the official governmental website of the Premier s office Torytube ca by comparison is a stylized rogue site What is a rogue Domain name fudging in combination with either satire or impostering constitutes rogueing Rogers 2000 Famous examples include www gwbush com and www gatt org the later being the WTO parody site of The Yes Men In a nutshell Torytube is a website that is claimed by the liberals only in the very small fine print Otherwise it is left to the user to decide what the editorial stance is of the site and whom it comes from The conclusion can t help but be negative but it is not explicitly stated as an objective of the site anywhere So Torytube is something of a trojan horse What is interesting about the structure of the Torytube site is that it is heavily dependent upon a complimentary torytube Youtube account Torytube the site aside from a repository of news clippings is really a stand alone showcase of embedded videos from the torytube Youtube account There are 27 videos on the torytube Youtube account in total with the most significant videos being repeated on the Torytube website 10 It is rather important to note in terms of Web 2 0 politics that although the Torytube website looks rather professional its content is primarily dependent upon other aggregators with Youtube being the most conspicuous Thus we see a major attack mechanism powered at its core by a free user account at a public aggregator Torytube does not even try to create stand alone videos everything is an embedded clip with the goal of being as viral as possible Considering the code structure of this site and its reliance on Youtube it would seem to be a model of cost and message control efficiency We can only speculate how much the sister site cost but it is not complicated enough to be extremely expensive And this politics 2 0 strategy had an impact as an examination of the number of Torytube videos in the top viewership results for the 4 weeks of the campaign is significant as our figures below reveal When pressed the liberals admitted ownership of Torytube ca however it is clearly a strategic decision to rogue the opponent and the media What we see in the case of the Liberal campaign is that neither the Premier s site nor the Premier s YouTube channel carried out the most offensive video politics in the Web 2 0 strategy of the incumbents Rather Torytube served as the platform for the more aggressive side of the campaign aided by other even less official liberal supporters who circulated videos TheTorytube name sounds like something that could be supportive of the PCs and the design of the site and its content masquerade as objective journalism This is not a new phenomenon but in this long tradition the new component is the embedded video clip especially considering the ubiquitous video surveillance the PC leader John Tory was subject to during the campaign Some of the most striking clips are a result of this over your shoulder type of videography and they were successfully spread to audiences through the Torytube account and site Thus we see since the actual content is distributed and the platforms nonproprietary a unique politics 2 0 strategy the augmentation of web 2 0 enabled practices via additional technology with consequences for the creation of discourses favourable to the Liberal campaign In the week of SEP 14th 4 out of 5 videos for John Tory were Liberal sourced and negative Indeed by the last week of the campaign all top 5 11 most viewed videos related to John Tory originated with Torytube Politicalguise and were all conclusively negative towards the PC leader None of the other parties were able to manifest such a coherent and concentrated 2 0 video strategy over the course of the campaign Drilling down we see the phenomenon of disguised partisanship Politicalguise Torytube overlap in their content despite the fact that Politicalguise is aside from its cheeky name unaffiliated Furthermore as discussed above aggregator recommendations based on metatags and viewership behavior affect meaning in the actor network This fact can be extended as a means of understanding the Liberal video strategy when it is examined closely we see the effects of practical virtuality and software as ideology Mackenzie 2006 Chun 2005 The existence of the Youtube platform influences the practices of the campaign and the resulting heterogeneous networks have consequences for the truth claims and discourses circulating online and presented to voters V NDP4TORY ca The Torytube website not content with fighting an offensive battle against the PC leader through the propagation of negative videos quotes Tory s head floating in the top left talks as the quotes scroll out on screen and news stories also spreads the invective through a second sister site called NDP4Tory ca which is dedicated to attacking the socialist New Democrat Party Thus we see politics 2 0 involves in this case rogues within rogues a kind of link based formation that is unified horizontally by linkage and vertically by aggregator hosted content The Liberal video attack on the main opponent the PC s is a kind of head on battle with a replete news archive focusing on the most divisive issue of the campaign the PC proposal to extend public funding to faith based schools The attack on the NDP however is more of a battle of position as the NDP rogue site mocks the socialists for supporting the progressive conservatives asserting the message that a vote for the NDP is really a vote for the PCs However when we dig 12 beneath the surface of the NDP4Tory attack site we see that the video content is once again the Torytube Youtube account VI The Three

tendencies have consequences for the political animal as politician and strategist Not to mention the public the voter and the media As we have seen some campaigns have already begun to think in a new way when it comes to politics 2 0 and in this case examined here the results have been notable The key tendencies are flattening flexibility and efficiency as well as a tendency to promote controversy and identity games It seems the Web 2 0 is a space for marginal voices and a more derogatory type of partisan video however it is striking to note that the presence of Youtube clearly shaped the video strategy of all parties with the Liberals executing a hydra like approach that was the most successful in targeting opponents In this way Youtube has taken a place alongside television as a front in any modern campaign lending credence to the claim that Web 2 0 platforms do act in an ideological capacity Chun 2005 The consequences for citizenship are harder to gauge but the overall picture is one of sporadic and limited participation by a host of individuals opposed to a given candidate This plethora of individual voices were joined at the lower end of the scale by fringe parties and public service campaigns But in the end citizens and small parties could not compete with the focused strategies of the major parties which were significantly aided by the structure of the Web 2 0 aggregator Youtube Thus while we may not exactly see a thinning down of citizenship a la P N Howard 2006 we do see an increase in undeclared affiliation controversy focused videos and limited opportunities for culture jamming due to copyright constraints Youtube as a Web 2 0 platform may seem to increase horizontal equivalence amongst uploaders but the Ontario 2007 provincial election showed clearly how an incumbent campaign well versed in politics 2 0 can dominate this ostensibly more democratic medium 23 Contact Info Zachary P Devereaux pdeverea ryerson ca www infoscapelab ca Bibliography Chun Wendy
