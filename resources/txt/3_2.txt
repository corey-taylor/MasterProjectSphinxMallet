University of London April 17 18 2008 BI DIRECTIONAL CIVIC ACTIVITIES Reflexivity in administrational and actionist approaches Abstract The use of ICTs and Computer Mediated Communication CMC is restructuring the politics and political activities as well as our understanding concerning them Enhanced communication exploiting digital technology accessible public spheres and asynchronous temporality of action on the web platforms transfigure the political culture and notion of the political itself This reflexive politics as we call that emerging phenomenon is challenging the older prevailing version of politics allowing the bi directional interactive involvement and embarking on the political matters Governments are using the ICT applications to involve citizens in the name of legitimating good governance and because of falls in voter turnout and people are exercising their newly discovered potentiality to pursue their own personal political goals We illustrate this ongoing transformation both from the perspective of the formal institutional politics and from the standpoint of citizen initiated reflexive politics with the help of empirical cases In the current situation two opposite discourses on citizenship and participation are salient They can be labelled administrational and actionist discourses The paper is outlining theoretical perspectives both regarding the use of computer mediated communication in involving the citizens to joint decision making and equally citizens engagement in personal political projects to transcend the normal limits and constraints of the formal politics The problematic nature of political participation and the ambiguities of political governance in civic involvement are to be analysed in the light of Finnish examples Secondly changes in the action and participation particularly reflexive activity by the people instead of activity for the people facilitated by ICT are reviewed In this respect we argue that politics becomes more kaleidoscopic smaller personal big politics emerging on diverse complex and multi spatial networks Thirdly the paper discusses the importance of public spheres in doing and transfiguration of politics 2 Introduction The Changing Scope of Political Participation What do we understand by the politics As a defined concept it refers to a number of phenomena or things that could be labelled as politics or at the minimum have some politically understood content in them A common way to grasp the notion of politics is to reduce it to mean the structures or institutions in which politics and political matters take place This view is traditionally considered a narrow perspective concerning politics However the notion does mean something else too One important aspect of it is a motion or an action that tries to achieve some valued goals or things and at the same time has reflexive relations between an actor and his her community see for instance Jung xiv xv 1979 In brief politics is both necessary and unavoidable Human societies need politics because by its implementation societies can be governed It is an instrument of distributing good and bad in communities finding out resolutions and resolving the conflicting views within communities allocating values with legitimate authority organising the changes and directions of communal life etc Politics is in a word an organised attempt to bring order in a pluralistic chaos See for instance Arendt 1958 Beetham 1991 Keane 1998 In many textbooks about the politics and political participation references are for granted pointing to the democratic political system This is no wonder In present day world the notion of democracy has bestowed an aura of legitimacy on political governing see Held 1997 78 In addition democratic ideal is by definition based on the popular participation in government In respect of participation and political activity per se orientation is to find out and clarify those conditions in which the governing is legitimate and acceptable Heywood 2004 220 The underlying tendency in these textbooks discourses is to define justifiable conditions or criteria of 3 democratic governing in whatsoever given society or association One of the most well known very influential principle is that in just political governing individuals ought to have an access in the decisions that affect one life Dye and Zeigler 1975 6 s In recent years the idea or impression of politics is somehow blurred This trend has a close connection to the social changes and processes that social scientists from different fields have observed in recent decades such as modernisation globalisation the fragmentation of societies individualisation and so forth The changing nature of a society changes the scope of social sciences as well In the study of politics that change has been visible Among political scientists the focus of research is shifting increasingly towards the civil society and its activity There is a new orientation in political science research activity by the people instead of activity for the people This change has also had a profound effect on the notion of citizenship which in modern democracies seems to parallel to the right to vote However electoral participation has decreased in recent decades and political culture is taking steps in the path to more reciprocal direction Emerging rival articulations in regard of citizenship contain more having a voice during electoral periods aspects That means a greater involvement and say in decisions concerning the future shape of community society Citizens activism and forming groups in order to express opinions and attitudes is part of the process linked to societal change More and more often political claims are channeled through organizations of civil society And as the number of such expressions increased the more serious civil society organisations are recognised by traditional political institutions To study the politics is to study the spontaneous voluntary civic activity within the political system emerging in the frames of civil society and in its multiple organisations This altering of scope is contrary to the earlier top down model of politics The transformation has controversial implications actionist and administrational consequences Nevertheless the public 4 or political issues are not loosing their significance in people minds in fact politics still matters s Only the forms and forums along with the concept of political activity and participation are changing In the current turmoil two opposite discourses on political citizenship in respect of civil involvement and participation are somehow salient and we label them as administrational and actionist discourses The first one aims to create and rationalise the practices of participation from above e g the planning of land use and urban construction good governance practices The latter discourse strives for bringing alternative meanings and practices from below e g the criticism of official influence opportunities the inhabitants own initiatives and plans citizens public action Due to the actionist do it yourself tendency political environment has fractured into a diverse complex and multi spatial network The significance and sensibility of political participation springs not only from the impact and consequences of the action but also from the participative action itself One ongoing and in many various ways launched attempt to increase citizens political participation is linked to the use of computer mediated communication CMC especially the Internet Using the Internet seems to be very promising tool to deploy in overcoming the apathetic traditional political involvement and empowering the commitment to political issues Both institutional and civil societal actors and even single individuals have noticed that Internet and other CMC related technical applications have inherently politically facilitating features The purpose of this paper is to outline a theoretical perspective on the use of computer mediated communication as a political tool channel and forum enabling the people to transcend the normal limits and constraints of politics In setting the context the paper first considers the problematic 5 nature of political participation References are especially made to ambiguities of political governance in respect to the case of political civic involvement in a Finnish context Secondly changes in the modes of action and participation are in focus In particular Finnish actionist civic politics facilitated by CMC is reviewed Thirdly the paper sets research cases in the context of reflexive politics that illustrates conflicts arising from clashes of differents subjective values lifestyles and attitudes As we understand reflexive politics it refers both to the politicisation of private worries and issue specific questions and to political judgement and to outcomes resulting in action Therefore the term reflexive politics provides an explanation of intuitively and instinctually emerging modes of politics that unfold in more an organised form of action in the subjective process of political judgement Häyhtiö Rinne 2008ab Finally the summary of theoretical points of view is to be found in the concluding remarks The Case of the City of Tampere Forming Administrational Public Involvement The discussions and practices of new public involvement have its roots in two different approaches which in very peculiar manner have converged to influence in the transformation of political participation culture These are New Public Management reforms and forms of political participation theory that have converted into innovations of public involvement During last decades various modernisation reforms have been conducted in different levels and fields of public administration in OECD countries The reforms have followed a philosophy of New Public Management NPM that is a broad and complex doctrine Most fundamentally it aims to improve the cost effiency of public sector by privatising marketising and utilising the management practices of economic life The effects of NPM reforms can be both vertical and horizontal For instance vertical reforms have created the methods of management by results large centralized profit centres harmonizing systems of quality and payroll and management practices supporting 6 representative political system On the other hand NPM reforms have been justified demanding the break up of hierarchical government desentralising deregulation admiministrative transparency and flexible horizontal governance see Hood 1999 Pollitt Bouckaert 2004 Public administration reforms have also strived to connect citizens better to decision making processes Citizens are considered as subjects with needs and wishes that have to be met in order to produce good efficient governance This is the reason why representative government is supplemented with range of devices for public hearing and consultation to ensure the direct representation of citizen s views see Pollitt Bouckaert 2004 The implementation of NPM strategies has led to the emergence of new practices and theories of political governance Pierre 2000a pp 1 3 Hirst 2000 p 18 Bingham et al 2005 p 549 It is defined that political steering has transformed from hierarchical decision making to horizontal networked governance of many actors public private and civil society sectors In political governance power responsibility and accountability have fractured and politics has changed to a complex arena of plural actors Pierre 2000b Bang 2003a One mode of political governance is public involvement culture which aims to construct and rationalise the practices of civic participation from above see Häyhtiö Keskinen 2005 Bingham et al 2005 Bang 2003b The culture of public involving is a model of new steering imperative inclusive political communication which invites lay people to exercise civic influence in new access points and to partake in a systemic decision making process Bang 2003a In addition to NPM reforms the culture of public involving has been influenced by the fact that the distance between political parties and citizens is widening The ongoing discussion of political alienation is an expression of concern about the unpopularity of political participation The reigning political elite has recognised the need for the formation of new medias for deliberation and forums 7 of participation to bring about a more justified and legitimate form of governance The aim and the promise of various local regional national EU and global participatory projects and initiatives consist of closer bonds between public officials politicians and citizens The purpose is to create and introduce such procedures within the political governing system that strengthen the legitimacy and accountability of political decision making Coleman Gøtze 2001 Macintosh et al 2002 Malina 2003 Tsagarousianou 1999 Schulman et al 2003 Schlosberg et al 2007 The practices of public involvement are based on the ideas given by the participatory democracy theory deliberative democracy theory and e democracy which all stress the importance of citizen participation in public political deliberation and decision making Bingham et al 2005 Häyhtiö Keskinen 2005 Dahlberg 2001 These models of participation aspire to political deliberation in which people are motivated to deliberate in a civil and reasonable manner Theories emphasise the distribution of information and knowledge as a material used by public in order to form arguments or to support their political opinions so that confidence among citizens increases A democratic community is therefore to be founded on solidarity and intellectual deliberation and effective cooperation The admission of legitimacy emerges from reasonable logical and knowledgeable arguments that are approved by a majority Häyhtiö Keskinen 2005 p 430 The characteristic feature of this new public involvement culture is that it is voicing the citizens in such matters that fit into the context of representative political governance The representative bodies or civil servants set the agenda The citizens themselves do not set the agenda see Macintosh et al 2002 Malina 2003 Tsagarousianou 1999 Schulman et al 2003 Schlosberg et al 2007 Wiklund 2005 Albrecht 2006 Thus active civil discussion is about matters which are considered suitable and usually they are rather harmless or insignificant Blaug 2002 Lappalainen 2006 Häyhtiö Rinne 2006 Nevertheless despite the fact that the topics of desired civil 8 discussion are fixed the very tendency to seek more legitimacy by allowing the citizens to participate in governing tells of the transformation of the political culture Those in power recognise the need to find out the attitudes and opinions of people at intermediate times between elections see Bang Dyrberg 2003 The significant feature of the political governance articulated in the 1990 is the emergence of the s idea of having a more inclusive political decision making model by offering the citizens a media to participate in decision making see Bevir 2003 Bang 2003 In Finland such projects involving public response are salient both within the context of local and national policymaking Amongst these new channels to empower people are digital networks especially the Internet They offer new methods of utilising democratic participation Most of the experimental public involvement eprojects utilise fairly similar infrastructures of computer mediated communication notably various Internet applications In general the electronic democracy discourse is marked by two grand promises the citizen free access to public information and open discursive deliberation on the s electronic Net Tsagarousianou 1999 In Finland local projects offering digital media to participate in decision making give an interesting insight into the new public involvement culture In many reports the website of the city of Tampere1 is referred to as a best practice for local citizen oriented e governance see Anttiroiko et al 2005 The website2 of the City of Tampere can be analysed as a comprehensive case of administrationally organised public involvement The site applications on the Participation Portal s Osallistuminen in Finnish 3 are connected to a dominant representative system in other words 1 Tampere is the third largest city in Finland and the largest inland centre in the Nordic countries Currently there are over 200 000 inhabitants in Tampere and almost 300 000 inhabitants in Tampere Sub Region which comprises Tampere and its neighbouring

The website offers a range of eservices and even allows and encourages civic debate concerning the governing of the city see the website of the City of Tampere www document The city has put a lot of effort into the enhancement of civic net participation by constructing Participation Portal in Finnish Osallistuminen www document which consists of the following parts 1 information about municipal government and participation opportunities as well as the contact information 2 permanent channels of e participation feedback facilities discussion sites and a Questions Answers service 3 topical consultations Internet user surveys since 1997 budget polls since 1999 and various consultations on issues such as traffic zoning and services 4 opportunity to initiate official motions and monitor their progress links to other discussion and participation arenas such as children and young people forums s s 5 links to other discussion and participation arenas such as children and young people forums s s Seppälä 2003 1 The governance model presented in the City of Tampere Participation Portal website as well as various other fairly similar administrative public involvement projects attempts to answer glocalised modernisation pressures by engaging the citizens in the communicative processes of political regime The public organisations strive towards dialogic relationships with various stakeholders because political environments have become highly complex and fragmented Political government cannot be anymore carried out by non communicative hierarchical steering Bang 2003c 243 244 The Participation Portal of the city of Tampere is an excellent example of how a representation system tries to connect to the political community stakeholders and citizens The s political managers and administrators have to demostrate nowadays that they want to be in 10 cooperative relationships with civil society and citizens so that they can generate the legitimacy of political steering Bang 2003c 252 In the planning decision making and realisation of the future of the city all of us are needed The inhabitant has a right to participate in taking care of common matters The city of Tampere develops the possibilities of the inhabitants participation Our purpose is to hear and to listen to more inhabitants than before in all matters concerning the city An introduction to the Participation Portal http www tampere fi osallistuminen index html translation Häyhtiö The public involvement culture adopted by public organisations addresses several rhetorical promises relating to citizens empowerment customer orientation opening up participation channels and the creation of multiple partnership relations etc Bang 2003b 243 The report of the city of Tampere Working Group for Improving Citizens Opportunities for Participation states that the residents civil servants and the elected representatives have to be in closer interaction than before so that representative democracy can be strengthened by direct participation The City of Tampere 2003 Furthermore it is proposed that the whole organisational culture of the city need to be changed so that civic participation can become an inherent aspect of political and administrative culture Anttiroiko 2004b 380 The City wants to organise a responsive participation culture so that the citizens would be activated in participating in the preparation and taking care of matters related to their own living environment The report also underlines that active participation in the city affairs would have integrative effects for the local community and public policy activities the City of Tampere 2003 According to Henrik Bang public involvement culture strives to construct feasible citizen empowerment which means inviting people to exercise civic influence at new access points and to participate in systemic decision making In networked society the public authorities want to create 11 an administration related participative culture which is effective for the legitimacy coherence and the decision making of the organisation Thus communicative governance refers to the social practices of a modernised political community in which the rulers attempt to socialise and regulate people conduct in an indirect manner by working on their identities and thereby their values s feelings attitudes and beliefs via a variety of new interactive modes of dialogue and co operation Bang 2003b 246 247 In practice governance in political systems has to be based on complex communicative and interactive practices The e governance model of the city of Tampere gives an outlook on the features of electronic civic participation organised by public authorities It seems to share a general belief that the citizens awareness of societal affairs is a precondition for meaningful citizen participation and making them intrested in systemic governance issues The website of the city has made available a wide variety of information about the city plans reports policy alternatives and s proposals For instance all the agendas and the minutes of the municipal bodies are published on the website at the same time as they are sent to the decision makers The Participation Portal especially extensively disseminates extensively information on opportunities of participation procedures local current affairs formal instructions and regulations Accordingly the city of Tampere wants to provide residents with background information in order to help them produce and express reasonable comments to the authorities and political representatives on local issues Seppälä 2002 Seppälä 2003 the City of Tampere 2003 13 21 23 The Preparation Forum of the City in Finnish Tampereen kaupungin valmistelufoorumi VALMA www document is the most innovative two way application of the Participation Portal The Forum was launched in spring 2003 with the support of the City Working Group for Improving Citizens Opportunities for Participation The City of Tampere 2003 www document During 12 2003 2005 75 administratively launched discussion topics were published on the Preparation Forum discussion site and 630 citizen floors took place on the public forum In addition 239 unpublished4 individual opinions were e mailed to preparing officials The city officials describe the functioning of the Preparation Forum in the following manner Residents of the municipality will be secured a means of delivering feedback and participating in case preparation from beginning to end As soon as the decision is made to open a case for preparation when the case is for instance entered into working plans the secretary or spokesperson of the committee places a notice about this on the website of the municipality The notice will be accompanied by a feedback form returnable to the preparing official committee secretary or elected officials The network debate concerning the case is recorded on a discussion forum When the preparation proper begins preparation documents in digital form will be available to the residents via the Internet Uurtamo 2003 It must be acknowledged that several aspects of participatory deliberative e democracy theory materialise in the City Internet forums People participate in the deliberations as equal citizens s the participants could be considered equal speakers and performers in relation to one another Electronic deliberations with the background information provided could be considered as processes of political reasoning and argumentation and the deliberations are free and public Presentations are not generally hindered or restricted by any authority and they are all public rf Dahlberg 2001a 2001b Although it has to be acknowledged that the city discussion services s are premoderated Seppälä 2002 2003 Participation is voluntary and its aim is to influence local politics although people do not actually have a direct opportunity to contribute to policymaking However the explicit aim of the City website forums is to promote democracy and the citizens s opportunities to participate in politics The forums therefore seem to seek a kind of consensual politics by means of argumentative deliberation The aim of public deliberation is to legitimate 4 The citizens may choose whether they want to give their opinions in public or in private on the Preparation Forum 13 future policies In the forums participation is reciprocal Also background information on the issues under deliberation is provided This gives the participants an opportunity to justify their arguments and to assess the arguments delivered by others At first sight the Preparation Forum may seem a very tempting channel to partake in municipal decision making because it provides easy access for residents bring forward their opinions to concerning issues on the agendas of the committees and to participate in discussion It is also declared that citizen opinions are e mailed directly to the elected officials and municipal employees concerned and collected into a summary enclosed in the minutes of the committee Anttiroiko et al 2005 398 Evidently a number of city dwellers very much appreciate the new medium and utilise the services that Tampere websites offer However Preparation Forum s s participation figures illustrate that the vast majority of the city dwellers do not take a part in efacilitated discussions nor have any idea whatsoever what subjects are current topics in the city s discussion forums Häyhtiö Keskinen 2005 Anttiroiko et al 2005 The obvious obstacle to increasing participation in decision making is the fact that too many citizens feel that the activation of the political dialogue is a fake attempt on the side of the political elite Häyhtiö Rinne 2006 The City of Tampere website and its Participation Portal are modern virtual spaces for political action facilitated by new ICT Theoretically they are ideal examples of deliberative participative edemocracy The key preconditions of this theoretical viewpoint materialise quite extensively in the online forums Information resources are distributed the participants are considered equal and everybody has a say Moreover the deliberators are mostly well educated and they have at least to some degree a chance to influence decision making Thus it is quite obvious how the tradition of participatory democracy thinking has given organic civic participation ideas to the public involvement practices which aims to construct and rationalise the practicies of participation from above Both approaches are in favour of construction of a political discussion environment which 14 adheres to an assumption of civil sociability The concept of civil signifies in this context a kind of erudition and a level of competency in deliberation on the basis of which people feel capable of cooperation and of trusting each other Co operation and trust engender predictability and certainty about the action and its effects Politics therefore becomes sociable politics in which conflicts emerge on the political agenda but in which they are resolved in the harmony created by civic deliberation rf Mouffe 2000 The paradox in many projects that are invented to increase political participation is that they do not actually empower the citizens Quite the contrary people do not believe that they might have an opportunity to make a difference in local national governing because the agenda is already set and what is the single most important factor is that the voice of the citizens is heard but it doesn t necessarily have any influence That is that the decision makers do not have to take that voice in to account there is no imperative in that voice This is a very vital point according to the classics of participation theory Arnstein 1974 people feel more empowered if they are given real tools to influence Strong participation means collaboration and actual influential participation in decisionmaking The crucial question to be answered is Can the political dialogue flourish on websites especially if the representatives of the political system set the agenda in advance and it is not responding to the initiatives of citizens If citizens themselves could bring out the topics of discussion in electronic agora and if their opponents politicians and leading office holders would step in to focus representing their lines of argumentation would that activate civil participation Or is it simply that in intensive and often conflicting issues the dialogue between rulers and ruled is basically impossible because citizens are perceived as non professional but yet somehow the legitimate voice of political needs The case of Tehotuotanto net Intensive farming as horizontal vertical style of participation 15 The other side of political participation and involvement concerns with citizen initiated activities which is more horizontal in nature when compared with the administrational involvement Of course to be effective the citizen initiated activity should include vertical elements too That is to have an impact and at least get public attention the political actionist campaigns ought to breakthrough into wider consciousness in order to have a say to the official political agenda It does necessarily have no role in the actual decision making processes but the topics may arise from private public spheres in which people are pointing out social or political evils In some cases civic activism brings the plurality of opinions ostensive and starts a kind of snow ball effect that in the end leads to the changes in the legislative level Nowadays the forms and forums to promote whatsoever political agenda or ends even for single individual are numerous The development of light portable digital technology has had its effects in empowering the citizens too Easily accessed publication channels and applications together with the development of technology have empowered people and enable them to distribute what ever material to the public spheres on the Internet Among this self broadcasted content there are also stuff that has political relevancy and significance On the open sphere within the Internet the creativity of civic agents flourishes and takes many forms in pursuit of aimed political goals Such forms found on the Internet are for instance emailing blogging disseminating information through the means of citizen journalism building up groups and communities on the social networking sites cf Chadwick 2007 290 In this we find a sharp contrast between the politics from above big and small do it yourself politics By sharing self made content on the web 2 0 environment people are involving themselves in peerto peer politics By introducing their political visions aims and means they may put forth 16 interactivity between individuals and create a kind collectivistic network of a new type People may choose to join the discussion take required actions like signing the petitions taking part to virtual sit ins and so Such networks based on everyday activism and swarming see Häyhtiö Rinne 2008b are results of individual personal responsible taking and thus they resemble the s Micheletti notion of individualized collective action see more Micheletti 2003 28 in which s public and private concerns are coupled together One of the most interesting characteristic in regard to that individual responsible taking is that it could analytically be distinguished into three categories in terms of the degree of its intensiveness At the first level individual shows interest towards some particular issue and is in principle ready to take some action to pursue that issue and help on campaigning This level is engagement The second level is involvement in which individual actually does something concrete In other words She he gives her his time and efforts to make a difference and participate in action for sake of the wanted goal The third and final level of individual responsible taking is commitment In this level individual is ready to make sacrifices and share her his private resources more intensively than at the earlier phases At this point it is sufficient to state that this final level comes in terms with a full time activist In addition some characteristics describing the everyday maker Bang Sörensen 1998 are also useful in defining or conceptualising the principle guiding the commitment through activity Bang and Sörensen has several features 1998 23 25 defining the identity of the everyday maker but in this text three most essential features to catch the idea of reflexive individual responsible taker are DO IT YOURSELF DO IT BECAUSE YOU FIND IT NECESSARY DO IT CONCRETELY 17 Finnish animal rights activists applied above mentioned principles while committing themselves into direct covert action during 2006 2007 According to Oikeutta eläimille association Justice for Animals the animal rights activists performed an investigation During the investigation we visited 101 Finnish factory farms and filmed with digital cameras The filming was conducted mostly inside the sheds and sometimes through the vents The buildings were never broken into since the doors were unlocked We paid particular attention to disease risks by changing clothes and shoes before entering and using respirator masks Tehotuotantanto net www document The adopted model for action could be called a individualised civic watch see Häyhtiö Rinne 2008b even though that the website containing the material of that investigation is maintained and administrated by Justice for Animals association Digital broadcasting technology enables the reflexive politics in the form of civic watch and this option was realised by animal rights activists The Justice for Animals association claims they have only received the sent material and put it on their website The actual action has been taken by unknown active individuals who have acted according to the statement found on animal rights association website s independently and as individuals So the activists are not representing any organisation In their own words Our identities are not important what counts are the results of this investigation which are shown on this website Sometimes one just can t sit back and wait for somebody to do something We simply just got up and took action for the defenceless The results from the investigation show that suffering animals are not an exception but a rule in Finnish animal production This material shows that animal suffering is an inseparable part of the production animals are seen as products and commodities instead of sentient beings What happens behind the closed doors of the Finnish factory farms is a wrong that exceeds the act of opening those unlocked doors and documenting the horrors We haven t destroyed any property instead we are just revealing existing facts Tehotuotanto net www document So the motive to taking actions in defending the animal rights reflects on personal or individual responsible taking The reason why then these videos were uploaded on the site of the existing 18 animal right organisation was that the purpose of those footages meets the goals of the association itself Both videos and association aim to reveal the truth of Finnish animal production The campaign was launched by the help of Finnish national broadcasting company Yleisradio YLE In one of the most popular programme handling the current topics A Studion reportaasi Reportage of A studio in November 28 clips from the footages were shown That was the departure point of the campaign against intensive farming After the starting video collage there were a TV talk in which the head of Finnish Food Safety Authority Jaana Husu Kallio and philosopher Elisa Aaltola discussed about the standards and ethics of Finnish animal farming During the following days the topic of the treatment of animals in food production blossomed It was a hot stuff in news and current affairs programme Most Finnish TV channels made reportages of the issue and interviewed both animal rights activists and farmers A short and incomplete list of the TV programmes is below 29 11 2007YLEn aamu tv MTV3 klo 22 uutiset YLE morning news MTV3 ten o s clock news 3 12 2007 Nelosen uutiset Channel four News 4 12 2007 Ajankohtainen kakkonen Channel 2 current affair programme s 5 12 2007 MTV3 klo 19 uutiset Nelosen uutiset MTV 3 seven o clock news Channel four news In all these programmes the case of Tehotuotanto net was treated in a journalistically profound and sound manner After gaining public awareness through media attention the campaign moved to Internet Oikeutta eläimille Justice for Animals association offered to tender the efficient server for the Tehotuotanto net Internet campaign The original server proved to be powerless to handle the massive flow of requests thus it was jammed and was out of order for couple of days in the beginning of campaign 19 By publishing the shocking material that has delivered to them anonymously the Justice for Animals managed to launch campaign of a new type and at the same token update their political style in their information disseminating which has always been one of the cornerstones of Finnish animal rights activities Earlier these actions took their places on the streets by collecting the names for petitions handing out flyers sticking posters and banners all over the walls and fences publishing the radical magazine and participating in different panels and popular events Despite the fact that animal rights association has been active on the net environment more than ten years the Tehotuotanto net rallying brought something new regarding association styles and forms of s activities In fact it was vital injection of a sort for animal rights activism because it aroused and invoked public interest and caused a vivid fussing in the public discussion and within social media in web 2 0 environment In many newspaper articles and letters to the editor the treatment of animals in the Finnish farming industry was considered a social evil that should be solved On the other side investigatory journalism tried to find out whether the accusations of Justice for Animals association were true In public many farmers take a defensive stance and explained that the animals are treated according to the accepted standards and the demands of the customers have lead to the conditions under which animals are living in the farms Farmers were eager to emphasise that they did not have treat animals in illegal manner A bit ironically that has been the point of animal activist more than ten years They have stated that the living conditions of production animals is not an exception but a rule in Finnish animal production a nimals are seen as products and commodities instead of sentient beings Tehotuotanto net www document The whole point of their campaign was to make it publically known Thanks to modern technology the delivering the message is more effective and convincing than in the early phase of activism 20 One interesting feature in Finnish campaign was the reaction of public and consequences on the Internet Quickly after publishing the videos of Tehotuotanto net the formation of supporting groups were founded on social networking site like Facebook having 2 582 members and collection of links to mass media sources that have dealt with the issue and MySpace In addition some boycotting attempts not to buy traditional ham for Christmas were launched too The effect of such boycotts whether they decrease the selling of intensively farmed meat is not known yet Reflexive politics on the Internet Internet research has shown how cost efficiently resource poor political actors can utilise digital technologies in reducing the cost of their actions and forming actionist networks Most commonly the Net is studied from the perspectives of enabling participation creating the structural composition of action networks and their continuations or shaping the organizational form of political activity Garrett 2006 pp 203 204 The accessibility of www browsers in the 1990 s created a setting for the notion of Web 1 0 that refers to easy to use computer mediated communication The expanding growth in the capacity of computing devices software and data transfer led to the final breakthrough of the Internet and multiplied the number of users The Internet became a graphic environment in which people can consume publish content freely create sites and communities seek linked information surf from one place to another and entertain themselves conduct politics and meet people Walch 1999 pp 39 49 Chadwick 2006 pp 45 47 In computer mediated communication the most significant political feature is de medialization which refers to the fracturing mediator role of mass media and the emergence of horizontal communication As the Internet expanded new styles of communication activism arose because it was impossible to control them and anybody could try to bring matters to public discussion Walch 1999 pp 67 75 21 Studies considering citizen oriented politics have shown a growing interest in the paradigm shift in the political use of the Internet labelled as a politics of Web 2 0 The notion of Web 2 0 encompasses sites based on user generated content networking and sharing Wyld 2007 Today the services and applications offered by the Internet are largely commercial but this has not hindered political spontaneous civic activity in emerging onto the platforms of social media In fact it is understood that Web 2 0 sites in general are transforming the Internet into a mode of space where users do not simply discuss but do things together O Reilly 2005 It presents an Internet where contents are created and shaped by networking individuals Wyld 2007 pp 43 44 Chadwick 2006 pp 8 In user generated content production individuals themselves control creation processes by developing classifying architecting or evaluating Web content Indeed Web 2 0 sites can be defined as peer to peer media in which collectivities consist of the choices of individuals to connect to platforms and to act voluntarily in them O Reilly 2005 Web communities can also materialise sources of collective political activity when swarming and meshworking individuals visit interesting websites and hubs to solve problems or attain shared aims or orientations The multitude of individuals may grow into a politically effective force if they unite By meshworking the swarming effect turns the plural into unity cf Osterweil 2004 p 504 Through the Internet actors may disseminate their aims and agenda horizontally from peer to peer by opening new public places within the complex structure of overlapping public spheres micro meso and macro public spheres which form according to John Keane 2000 pp 77 78 a c omplex mosaic of differently sized overlapping and interconnected public spheres In addition the employment of CMC offers multiple layers of spatial asynchronous contexts and opportunities to mobilize and advocate political pursuits Publishing and sharing self made media content horizontally through the Net is a process in which media outputs are received and conceived by 22 their audiences in discursive and interactive manners In this context any issue may take on political relevance The meanings of these outputs are formed through communicative practises of sharing and delivering self created material and information Meaning making is open ended even loose talk in which politics can materialise in the context of discursive interaction when the new ways of framing social political issues new ways of perceiving and new formulations of strategies are formed cf Dahlgren 2006 279 The processes can be reciprocal mutual attempts or launched even by a single active individual It is possible to define issues as political in other words politicise chosen topics by denaturalising the conventional perceptions or through ironic and sardonic approaches Häyhtiö Rinne 2008a The CMC enable digital micro politics that fosters the new ideas and modes of action along with the snowball effect that can during a timely course of action permeate into meso or even macro political publicness The asynchronous temporal dimension is then fortified when people decide to join the original online campaign after noticing it from some other media Hence the Internet is to be considered as a locus channel and to some extent even a temporal space for political and communicative action participation and mobilization Meikle 2002 Donk et al 2004 della Porta Mosca 2005 Garrett 2006 Häyhtiö Rinne 2008ab The empowering potentiality of the Internet is so impressive that hardly any serious political actor or wanna be actor could overlook its facilitating features Chadwick 2006 The technical development of the Internet and the plural forms of communication empower activity by opening a radically individualised environment where personal concerns may be politicised The effects of the Internet on political civic empowerment can be analysed as follows First computer mediated communication is a resource for the activity The Internet has modified movements and organisations making them more networked flexible and polycentric making 23 collective mobilisation easier and increasing the opportunities for direct action The Net also facilitates the construction and strengthening of collective identities and the distribution of alternative information della Porta Mosca 2005 p 185 Second micro public spheres of the Net are potential places for the usage of actionist power the Net is an open space both for political judgements and opinions and for choosing political styles On the Net basically anybody can try to influence matters that are considered important Lappalainen 2006 Third the communication platforms on the Internet construct personalised connections such as user identifications bookmarks link listings archives email lists blogs etc which may be latent connections of social networks for a long time but in the unpredictable situations of Net politics they may become politically significant nodes cf della Porta Mosca 2005 p 186 Fourth the Internet as an experience based space enables different learning processes through which individuals can improve their self governance related for instance to technical skills information retrieval and self generated content and knowledge Chadwick 2007 Dahlgren 2006 which are also crucial arts for practising spontaneous Net politics Individualised Civic Watch as a Form of Reflexive Politics One recently emerged form of politics is the individualised civic watch which stems from the idea of reflexive political action being intertwined in all aspects of the empowering effects of the Internet Civic watching improves the self governance of the individual own life in pursuing s his her political objectives Hence the individualised civic watch complements the traditional watchdogs of power such as broadcast media and civil society organisations The political motive for an individual is to enter into public discussions via horizontal communication in order to have an effect on people opinions It seeks to influence other individuals behaviour and action at s the level of their everyday lives The persuasive arguments could be addressed either to universal or particular audiences Perelman Olbrechts Tyteca 1969 pp 28 30 As such it reflects the 24 fragmentation of the traditional institutional political environment into more diverse complex and multi spatial networks in which personal responsibility taking is replacing centralised political governing and shifting the focus onto the acting individual subject Micheletti 2003 p 20 McDonald 2006 p 14 Formal politics is scaled down by the multiplication of individually generated public spheres Bentivegna 2006 p 339 in which political activity participation and mobilisation emerge from the issue specific questions through personal political judgement based on intuitive and subjective values In this vein the individual civic watch is one increasingly strengthening form of reflexive politics referring to the transformation of political activity and participation in which political issues are springing from the basis of subjectively felt wrongs reflecting personal political judgement Häyhtiö Rinne 2008 An approach of this kind emphasises the activity of the people Do it yourselfattitude and extends the dimension of politics in a more personalised direction The individual civic watch emerges from bi directional interactive applications found on the Internet and it may even occur on the commercially governed sites such as YouTube com DIY activists creativity in utilising commercial though costless platforms is noteworthy because so far most commentators have believed that spontaneous civic activity is unthinkable in commercialised environments e g Atton 2004 p 3 The commercial nature of the platforms seems not to bother active citizens because publishing is free In fact swarming increases the advertising potential of sites that become popular When an individually politicised issue is made publicly accessible anyone can participate in it or share in it Heller 2006 p 318 Through publicness the reflexive individualised activity reaches its audiences That turns the particular issue into a universal publicly known one ibid p 321 If and when other people are agreeing with the sent message and sharing the same sort of sentiment 25 individuals initiative forms a collectivity consisting of a variety of personal political judgements and eventually evolves into an actionist network The development of CMC has enhanced the possibilities of citizens pursuing their political aims through self made publicity To be persuasive in this requires some technical skills to be applied such as photo shopping and editing information and pieces of news Dahlgren 2006 p 279 The success of alternatively produced communication lays also in timing and the capability of exploiting chances in opening political contexts The raison d of politically intended interventions are the most effective when the general feelings of the etre public are resonated or at least are taken as being politically relevant for some segments of diversified audiences cf Dahlgren 2006 p 276 People individual choices concerning the course of their reactions and actions may impact on a s larger social problem or thematic entity Such an individualized collective action see Micheletti 2003 is not directed from above neither is it organised or centralised It is not coordinated action and the course of collective activity utilises the self made public sphere publicness and the styles and forms of the action are taking their shape intuitively in anonymous and fluid network flows where unpredictable events occur McDonald 2006 p 9 Individual collective activity arises on the basis of individually made judgements of a prevailing situation deploying the existing possibilities and infrastructural facilities An individualised civic watch creates the new types of relations between political agents The uses of interactive platforms generate new loci for meaningful action see Perelman Olbrechts Tyteca 1969 p 83 and in these meet up places people can share their fluctuating concerns and form constantly altering alliances around changing issues The Internet is a space to conduct and to enhance the art of political judgement Due to demedialized public spheres users turn out to be active actors judging content for themselves and making choices Walch 1999 pp 70 Häyhtiö Rinne 2008 Thus the Internet provides an 71 26 opportunity for anybody to intervene in different levels of publicness addressing self generated agenda if the issue gets intensified accumulation acceleration and support by other like minded individuals As an interactive media the Internet can challenge and on some occasions even replace the centralised and sometimes controlled or else censored mass media by offering independent alternative information about the world s events Bentivegna 2006 p 339 User friendly and easy accessible applications such as YouTube Flickr Facebook Myspace enable the creation of crossand interlinked horizontal public places on the Internet The chance to exercise surveillance is practically within reach of anyone who is capable of making good use of the CMC Utilising the complex overlapping structures of interconnected public spheres it is possible to influence public opinion by disseminating information concerning politicians blunders or the misconduct of officials Concluding remarks This paper has outlined a theoretical perspective on the use of computer mediated communication as a political tool channel and forum enabling people to transcend the normal limits and constraints of politics in late modern liberal democracies Looking back to recent years political economic and technological developments such as the breakage of ideological divides the strengthened globalisation of economies and cultures the effects of ICT innovations the problems of welfare state politics the fragmentation of institutionalised politics etc and the ways that citizens have reacted to them e g the emergence of new social movements the resistance of economic globalisation the challenges to the norms and practices of representative democracy and the rise of urban political action demanding improvements in local democracy it is easy to perceive that the perspective of school old participation theory is too narrow 27 In the current situation administrational and actionist discourses on citizenship and participation are dominating the discussion Public authorities have learnt to apply new laws and governance principles and have involved citizens in decision making but the citizens have conducted their activity greatly somewhere other than in the institutionally organised participation process The political environment has fractured into a diverse complex and multi spatial network The significance and sensibility of the political participation springs not only from the impacts and consequences of the action but also the participative action itself It has been stated that different communication media may impact in an activating manner on political participation e g Bennett Entman 2001 In the field of new media the development of the Finnish model of the information society has been supported by the national and local government Castells Himanen 2002 Several on line forums and interactive web sites have been built up in order to empower citizens and to raise interest in public communal matters The idea of an active citizen in addition to the neologism of net democracy is widely in use By creating legislatively a range of interactive channels and forums for the actors within the civil society in order to lower the threshold of participation in political planning decision making and so on the government is trying to promote and strengthen the participation culture to avoid political alienation All these efforts are of course worth supporting and most laudable but as a criticism it must be stated that in western liberal democracies increasing and strengthening political participation has frequently been debated since the 1940 In this discussion only the instruments s tend to be replaceable Substituting the radio 1940 with the Internet 1990 and 2000 using a s s s new saviour machine is just old wine in new bottles No technical solution succeeds in making the change unless the opinion of the reigning elite remains the same in terms of sharing political power with citizens In addition regarding institutional politics as the only mode and form of 28 politics hinders the renaissance of political participation In this process the Internet may prove it s usefulness because digital technologies make possible a more interactive relationship between people and media Citizens adopt a more active relationship with information not just passively accepting what is fed through the broadcast medium but rather engaging with it and recreating it in intriguing creative ways The result might be a more energized citizenry and semiotic democracy the recoding and reworking of cultural meaning Palfrey 2004 www document Only by adopting the broader understanding of political participation is it possible to avert the alienation and ruination of the concept The most important effect of net empowerment is that it can create citizen oriented autonomous and authentic political participation which are well in harmony with the ideals of becoming who one really is and of being one s own person In the best possible scenario political power is communicative by nature in on line politics In political encounters on the Net both action and discourse are evolved in relation to political participation Well functioning boundary crossing public arenas in local national and global planes might lead to a kind of situation in which public spheres ensure that nobody owns power and which increase the likelihood that its exercise everywhere is rendered more accountable to those whom it directly or indirectly affects Keane 2000 88 In current political arenas the role of the Internet is crucial Various uses of the Internet facilitate different civic and individually organised networks and help to introduce their aims and strategies and to reach target groups and members of the public Also it is more efficient to run the core tasks of campaigning projects such as communicating with supporters coordinating events in the field 29 organising crowds in fast breaking situations reacting quickly to breaking news and gaining publicity for their issue Häyhtiö Rinne 2008a Various forms of individualised civic watching demonstrate that the new phenomenon of political Web communication is becoming more common Googling blogging clicking downloading uploading generating net contents and so forth have proved to be increasingly influential forms of political activity The Net based environment opens variety of possibilities for different styles and methods of political action reflecting individuals intentions and aims to emerge Lappalainen 2006 On social media platforms even individuals may try to gain support with their messages and become politically empowered actors without organisational resources It is up to message providers to decide what how and to whom they communicate The power of the Internet is based on its ability to provide horizontal communication with no gatekeepers between citizens and civic networks bypassing the traditional mass media The use of CMC have reduced the costs of stepping out in public but also technologies have transformed political communication so that the art of creating and mastering the content of the message ability to persuade and gain support are elementary in political activities Dahlgren 2005 p 215 Garrett 2006 p 214 In principal the accessible unconstrained communication and the horizontal nature of the Net radically shapes the understanding of political communication It seems to be an ideal space per se for DIY communication because the Net offers space for personal political judgments activities and debates detaching structural formal politics The Internet public spheres create self made publicness of a new kind in which individuals may promote their political projects In addition the open publicness facilitates the making of comments and remarks by other Net users As a channel the Internet is tolerant and produces repertoires of contention and challenging information It connects a many voiced crowd to discuss certain issues bringing participants from 30 various backgrounds together to share and contest their views The multitude of people may unite into a meshworked collectivity or the opinions may polarise or diversify Yet as a political facilitator and meet up place the Internet has shown its potentiality The horizontal participation and action culture characteristic of the Net is far more radically democratic than traditional vertical democratic governing Open and free Web communication based on the premise that all participants are equal changes the nature of political communication and deliberation The persuasiveness of arguments is dependent on the quality of argumentation not on the position or status of the participant The lack of personal face to face communication underlines the significance of appealing argumentation This feature is important when we think of its outcomes in regard to political action The transformative change is crystallised particularly in Net politics because it is used to mobilise supporters and gather coalitions Communicative reflexivity could be considered as a vitalisation of personal political empowerment where collectivities and communities might be constituted just by clicking the mouse
