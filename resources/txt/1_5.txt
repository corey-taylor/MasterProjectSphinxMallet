Lai J Carl Barrett Cathryn Lewis Susan Neuhausen Lisa Cannon Albright David Goldgar Roger Wiseman Alexander Kamb Mark H Skolnick A strong candidate for the 17q linked BRCA1 gene which influences susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer has been identified by positional cloning methods Probable predisposing mutations have been detected in five of eight kindreds presumed to segregate BRCA1 susceptibility alleles The mutations include an 11 base pair deletion a 1 base pair insertion a stop codon a missense substitution and an inferred regulatory mutation The BRCA 1 gene is expressed in numerous tissues including breast and ovary and encodes a predicted protein of 1863 amino acids This protein contains a zinc finger domain in its amino terminal region but is otherwise unrelated to previously described proteins Identification of BRCA1 should facilitate early diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility in some individuals as well as a better understanding of breast cancer biology Breast cancer is one of the most common and important diseases affecting women Current estimates indicate that one in eight American women who reach age 95 will develop breast cancer 1

cases but approximately 25 of cases diagnosed before age 30 2 Breast cancer has been subdivided into two types early onset and late onset a division that is based on an inflection in the age specific incidence curve around age 50 Mutation of one gene BRCA1 is thought to account for approximately 45 of families with significantly high breast cancer incidence and at least 80 of families with increased incidence of both early onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer 3 Intense efforts to isolate the BRCA1 gene have proceeded since it was first mapped to chromosome arm 17q in 1990 4 5 A second locus BRCA2 recently mapped to chromosome arm 13q 6 appears to account for a proportion of earlyonset breast cancer roughly equal to that resulting from BRCA1 Unlike BRCA1 however BRCA2 may not influence ovarian cancer risk The remaining susceptibility to early onset breast cancer is likely attributable to unmapped genes for familial cancer and rare germline mutations in genes such as TP53 which encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53 7 It has also been suggested that heterozygote carriers of defective forms of the gene predisposing to ataxia telangiectasia are at higher risk for breast cancer 8 9 Late onset breast can 66 SCIENCE advanced breast cancer is often futile and disfiguring making early detection a high priority in medical management of the disease Ovarian cancer although less frequent than breast cancer is often rapidly fatal and is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in American women VOL 266 7 OCTOBER 1994 cer is often familial in origin although the risks in relatives are not as high as those for early onset breast cancer 10 1 1 The percentage of such cases that are due to genetic susceptibility is unknown Like many other genes involved in familial cancer BRCA1 appears to encode a tumor suppressor a protein that acts as a negative regulator of tumor growth Cancer predisposing alleles typically carry mutations that cause loss or reduction of gene function Predisposition to cancer is inherited as a dominant genetic trait whereas the predisposing allele generally behaves as a recessive allele in somatic cells Thus a single inherited copy of the mutant allele causes predisposition and loss or inactivation of the wild type allele completes one of the steps in progression toward malignancy When chromosome loss is observed in breast and ovarian tumors from patients who carry BRCAI predisposing alleles the wild type copy of BRCA1 is invariably lost while the presumptive mutant allele is retained 12 14 This finding supports the hypothesis that BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene and suggests that the functional BRCA1 protein is present in normal breast and ovarian epithelium tissue and is altered reduced or absent in some breast and ovarian tumors Genetic analysis of recombinant chromosomes in members of large kindreds allowed localization of BRCA1 initially to a region of 1 to 2 megabases on chromosome 17q 1517 and subsequently to a region of about 600 kilobase pairs kb 18 between markers D17S1321 and D17S1325 19 A physical map comprised of overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes YACs P1 bacterial artificial chromosomes BACs and cosmid clones was generated for this region 18 Identification of a strong BRCAI candidate gene Several strategies were used to develop a detailed map of transcripts for the 600 kb region of 17q21 between D17S1321 and D17S1325 Sixty five candidate expressed sequences 20 within this region were identified Expressed sequences were characterized by DNA sequence database comparison transcript size expression pattern genomic structure and most importantly DNA sequence analysis in individuals from kindreds that segregate 17q linked breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility Three expressed sequences eventually were merged into a single transcription unit whose characteristics strongly suggest that it is BRCA1 21 This transcription unit is located in the center of the 600 kb region Fig 1 spanning D17S855 and will be referred to herein as BRCA1 A combination of sequences obtained from complementary DNA cDNA clones hybrid selected sequences and

kindreds range from 9 49 to 0 44 for a set of markers in 17q21 Four of the families have convincing lod scores for linkage and four have low positive or negative lod scores The latter kindreds were included because they demonstrate haplotype sharing at chromosome 17q21 for at least three affected members Furthermore all kindreds in the set display earlyonset breast cancer and four of the kindreds include at least one case of ovarian cancer both hallmarks of BRCAI kindreds Kindred 2082 has nearly equal incidence of breast and ovarian cancer an unusual occurrence given the relative rarity of ovarian cancer in the population 17 All but two of the kindreds were ascertained in Utah Kindred 2035 is from the midwestern United States Kindred 2099 is an African American kindred from the southern United States all other kindreds are Caucasian In the initial screen for predisposing mutations in BRCA1 DNA from one individual carrying the predisposing haplotype from each kindred was tested The 21 coding exons and associated splice junctions were amplified from either genomic DNA samples or cDNA prepared from lymphocyte mRNA 26 When the amplified DNA sequences were compared to the wildtype sequence four of the eight kindred samples were found to contain sequence variants Table 2 All four sequence variants are heterozygous and each appears in only one of the kindreds Kindred

6B and kindred 2099 contains a missense mutation in coding exon 21 Metl775Arg The frameshift and nonsense mutations are likely to disrupt the function of the BRCA1 proteins The protein encoded by the insertion allele in kindred 1910 would contain an altered sequence beginning 107 amino acids residues from the wild type COOHterminus The effect of the 1 1 bp deletion in kindred 1901 would be even more dramatic because it occurs at the twenty fourth codon This deletion removes the last 11 bp of exon 2 and begins at the first cystine of the zinc finger motif thereby removing the zinc finger domain The mutant allele in kindred 2082 would encode a protein missing 548 residues from the COOH terminus The missense mutation observed in kindred 2099 is potentially disruptive as it substitutes a large charged amino acid Arg for a small hydrophobic amino acid Met Five common polymorphisms were also identified in the BRCA1 coding sequence Table 3 The individual studied in kindred 2035 is likely to carry a regulatory mutation in BRCAl In her cDNA two polymorphic sites PM1 and PM7 appeared homozygous whereas her genomic DNA revealed heterozygosity at these positions Fig 6C One possible

fulfilled by the candidate predisposing mutations cosegregation of the mutant allele with diseases and absence of the mutant allele in controls indicating a low frequency in the general population 29 Phenotypic expression of BRCA1 mutations The effect of the mutations on the BRCA1 protein correlates with differences in the observed phenotypic expression in the BRCA1 kindreds Most BRCA1 kindreds have a moderately increased ovarian cancer risk and a smaller subset have a high risk of ovarian cancer comparable to that for breast cancer 3 Four of the five kindreds in which BRCA1 mutations were detected fall into the former category and the fifth kindred 2082 falls into the group with high ovarian cancer risk The BRCA1 nonsense mutation found in kindred 2082 has an interesting phenotype Kindred 2082 has a high incidence of ovarian cancer and the mean age of breast cancer diagnosis is older than that in the other kindreds 17 This difference in age of onset could be due to an ascertainment bias in the smaller more highly penetrant families or it could reflect tissue specific differences in the behavior of BRCA1 mutations The other four kindreds that segregate known BRCA1 mutations have on average 1 ovarian cancer for every 10 cases of breast cancer but have a high proportion of breast cancer cases diagnosed at an early age late 20s or early 30s Kindred 1910 which has a 1 bp insertion mutation is noteworthy because three of the four affected individuals had bilateral breast cancer and in each case the second tumor was diagnosed within a year of the first occurrence Kindred 2035 which segregates the potential regulatory BRCA1 mutation might also be expected to have a Downloaded from www sciencemag org on February 12 2008 coding region which are separated by as

carriers in kindred 2035 these polymorphic sites appeared heterozygous in cDNA implying that amplification from cDNA was not biased in favor of one allele This analysis indicates that a BRCA1 mutation in kindred 2035 either prevents transcription or causes instability or aberrant splicing of the BRCA1 transcript Cosegregation of BRCAI mutations with BRCA1 haplotypes and population frequency analysis In addition to potential disruption of protein function a sequence variant must meet two other criteria to qualify as a candidate predisposing mutation It must be present in members of the kindred who carry the predisposing haplotype and absent from other members of the kindred and it must be rare in the general population To test for cosegregation of mutations with the corresponding

is as high as any in the set suggesting that this BRCAJ mutant allele has a high penetrance Table 1 Kindred 1901 displays a phenotypic pattern similar to that of kindred 2035 It is likely that the 1 1 bp deletion beginning at codon 24 carried in kindred 1901 results in a loss of gene function similar to the effect of the regulatory mutation in kindred 2035 Although the mutations described in this research article are clearly deleterious causing breast cancer in women at very young ages each of the four kindreds with mutations includes at least one woman who carried the mutation but lived until age 80 without developing a malignancy It will be of utmost importance in future studies to identify other genetic factors or environmental factors that may ameliorate the effects of BRCA1 mutations In addition in three of the eight putative BRCAl linked kindreds potential predisposing mutations were not found All of these kindreds have lod scores for BRCAJ linked markers of less than 0 55 and thus may not truly segregate BRCAl predisposing alleles Alternatively the mutations in these three kindreds may lie in noncoding regions of BRCA and therefore have escaped detection The role of BRCA1 in cancer Most A P a b c d e f g mutant tumor suppressor genes identified to date encode proteins that are absent nonfunctional or reduced in function The majority of TP53 mutations are missense some of these have been shown to produce abnormal p53 molecules that interfere with the function of the wild type product 30 31 A similar dominant negative mechanism of action has been proposed for some adenomatous polyposis coli APC alleles that produce truncated molecules 32 and for point mutations in the Wilms tumor gene WTJ which alter DNA binding of the WT1 protein 33 The nature of three mutations observed in the BRCAI coding sequence is consistent with production of either dominant negative proteins or nonfunctional proteins All three mutations are located in the COOH terminal half of the protein The regulatory mutation inferred in kindred 2035 cannot be dominant negative rather this mutation likely causes reduction or complete loss of BRCA1 expression from the affected allele Similarly the 11 bp deletion in kindred 1901 likely produces a nonfunctional product The BRCAI protein contains a C3HC4 zinc finger domain similar to domains found in numerous nucleic acid binding proteins The first 180 amino acids of BRCA1 contain five more basic residues than acidic residues In contrast the remainder of the molecule is very acidic with a net excess of 70 acidic residues The excess negative charge is particularly concentrated near the COOH terminus Thus one possibility is that BRCA1 encodes a transcription factor with an NH2 terminal DNA binding domain and a COOH terminal acidic blob domain with transactivational activity Interestingly the product of another familial tumor suppressor gene WTl also contains zinc finger domains 34 and these are altered by many cancer predisposing mutations in the gene 33 35 The WT1 gene encodes a transcription factor and alternative splicing of exons that encode parts of the zinc finger domains alters the DNA binding properties of WT1 36 Some alternatively spliced forms of WT1 mRNA generate WT1 proteins that act as transcriptional repressors 37 Differential splicing of BRCA1 may alter the zinc finger motif Fig 3 raising the possibility that a regulatory mechanism similar to that occurring in WT1 may apply to BRCA1 The identification of a gene that i falls within the interval known from genetic studies to include BRCA1 and ii contains frameshift nonsense and regulatory mutations that cosegregate with predisposing BRCA1 alleles strongly indicates that this gene is BRCA1 The observation of potential predisposing

random sequencing of genomic DNA 40 and prediction of coding exons by XPOUND 41 These expressed sequences in many cases were assem bled into contigs composed of several independently identified sequences Candidate genes may comprise more than one of these candidate expressed sequences 21 Three independent contigs of expressed sequences 1141 1 649 bp 694 5 213 bp and 754 2 1079 bp were isolated by hybrid selection and eventually shown to represent portions of BRCA 1 When expressed sequence tags ESTs for 1 141 1 and 754 2 were used as hybridization probes for RNA blots a single transcript of approximately 7 8 kb was observed in normal breast mRNA which suggested that they encode different portions of a single gene Screens of breast fetal brain thymus testis lymphocyte and placental cDNA libraries and PCR experiments with breast mRNA linked the 1141 1 694 5 and 754 2 contigs 5 RACE experiments with thymus testis and breast mRNAs extended the contig to the putative 5 end yielding a composite full length sequence PCR and direct sequencing of P1 s and BACs in the region were used to identify the location of introns and allowed the determination of splice donor and acceptor sites 22 M Kozak Nucleic Acids Res 15 8125 1987 23 T F Smith and M S Waterman J Mol Biol 147 195 1981 24 S F Altschul W Gish W Miller E W Myers D J Lipman ibid 215 195 1990 25 We performed database comparison by using i BLAST alignment algorithms 24 on the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI databases ii Smith Waterman alignment algorithms 23 on a MasPar computer to search the SwissProt database at MasPar and at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and iii Smith Waterman algorithms on a Compugen Biocelerator at the Weizmann Institute to search the GenBank nucleotide and SwissProt protein databases 26 The templates for PCR were lymphocyte cDNA or genomic DNA from members of BRCA1 kindreds who carried the predisposing haplotype Sequences of PCR primers used to amplify each exon of BRCA1 are available upon request The PCR conditions were one cycle at 950C 5 min four cycles at 950C 10 s with the annealing temperature Tan at 680C for 10 s and at 720C for 10 s four cycles with Tann 66 C four cycles with Tann 64 C four cycles with Tann 62 C and 30 cycles with Tann 60 C The buffer conditions were as described 42 The PCR products were purified from 1 0 agarose gels with Qiaex beads QIAGEN analyzed by cycle sequencing with a 32P deoxy adenosine triphosphate 43 and subjected to electrophoresis on 6 polyacrylamide gels Polymorphisms were initially detected by eye on both strands and subsequently confirmed by ASO analysis 27 27 PCR products were generated as described 26 and quantified after electrophoresis through 2 agarose gels containing ethidium bromide by comparison with DNA standards PCR product 10 gi was added to 110 ul of denaturant 7 5 ml of H20 6 0 ml of 1 N NaOH 1 5 ml of 0 1 bromophenol blue and 75 ml of 0 5 mM EDTA and incubated for 10 min at room temperature Samples 30 u were then blotted onto Hybond membrane Amersham with a dot blotting apparatus Gibco BRL The DNA was fixed on the membrane by exposure to ultraviolet light Stratagene Prehybridization was carried out at 45 C in x5 SSPE 0 75 M NaCI 0 05 M NaH2Pu4 H2O and 0 005 M EDTA and 2 SDS 34 Wild type and mutant ASOs were labeled by incubation at 37 C for 10 min in a reaction that included 5 pCi of 32P adenosine triphosphate 100 ng of ASO 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase Boehringer Mannheim and kinase buffer 44 Labeled ASO 20 ng was used in an overnight hybridization reaction in the same buffer used for prehybridization Each blot was washed twice in x5 saline sodium citrate and 0 1 SDS for 10 min at room temperature and then for 30 min at progressively higher temperatures until nonspecific hybridization signals were eliminated Blots were exposed to x ray film for 40 min without an intensifying screen 28 The African American samples from Utah were from a newborn screening program 29 A reviewer suggested the possibility that this gene which we call BRCA 1 may contain frameshift mutations other than those detected here at a significant frequency in members of the general population 30 E Shaulian A Zauberman D Ginsberg M Oren Mol Cell Biol 12 5581 1992 31 S Srivastava S Wang Y A Tong Z M Hao E H Chang Cancer Res 53 4452

Canadian Genetic Diseases Network S N and the Cedars Cancer Institute of the Royal Victoria Hospital P T Downloaded from www sciencemag org on February 12 2008 whose early onset breast or ovarian cancer was not ascertained by family history supports the view that many early onset cases are due to mutations at the BRCAJ locus 38 The role of BRCAI in cancer progression may now be addressed with molecular precision The large size and fragmented nature of the coding sequence will make exhaustive searches for new mutations challenging Nevertheless the percentage of total breast and ovarian cancer caused by mutant BRCAI alleles will soon be estimated and individual mutation frequencies and penetrances may be established This in turn may permit accurate genetic screening for predisposition to a common deadly disease Although such research represents an advance in medical and biological knowledge it also raises numerous ethical and practical issues both scientific and social that must be addressed by the medical community Note added in proof Analysis of kindred 1911 indicates a possible linkage to BRCA2 suggesting that early breast cancer in this kindred is not due to a mutation of BRCAI 51 s 2 September 1994 accepted 14 September 1994 For information about an audio conference on the topic of the breast cancer gene BRCA1 see page 15 SCIENCE VOL 266 7 OCTOBER
