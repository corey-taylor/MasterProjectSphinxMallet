Vasiliki Vrana Department of Business Administration Technological Education Institute of Serres Greece v_vrana otenet gr Abstract Blogs have the advantage of speedy publication and an advantage in socially constructing interpretive frames for understanding current events Blogs appear to play an increasingly important role as a forum of public debate with knockon consequences for the media and for politics In Greece where the ratio of internet users is relatively small there is however an expanding portion of bloggers who comment regularly and have the power to a certain degree and in certain circumstances to trigger off political movements Based on the relative literature the paper locates Greek political blogs and provides indicators of their popularity and interconnections As a case study the paper considers the recent debate that took place on the Web relatively to the election of PASOK s new President Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement PASOK one of the two major parties in Greece was defeated on the national election of September 16 2007 and this defeat brought up a major leadership crisis Election for a new leader was held on November 11 2007 The paper examines the posts of blogs that were pros or cons the two main candidates for presidency for the period from September 16 to November 13 Using social networking theory and statistical analysis it presents and measures blogs connectivity conversational patterns and variations over time It examines the skewdeness of incoming blog links and finds the core blog groups that serve as focal points for political bloggers The paper adds to the study of political blogs by reporting patterns of blogging and making one of the few contributions to the study of political blogging in Greece Keywords blogs Greece

Introduction Drezner and Farrell 2004 p 5 defined weblogs as A web page with minimal to no external editing providing on line commentary periodically updated and presented in reverse chronological order with hyperlinks to other online sources Blogs can take a number of forms and tend to have a number of characteristics in common such as being set up to display blog postings in reverse chronological order or with their content arranged by subject each entry has a timestamp so that the reader knows when it was posted being updated regularly with new material providing a personal viewpoint give their readers an opportunity to comment on blog postings or to contact the author directly Pedley 2005 Blogs help self expression and self empowerment Blood 2002 In the business world blogs are considered as environments for knowledge sharing Festa 2003 a magic formula for corporate communication Jüch and Stobbe 2005 a potential for future profit Lu and Hsiao 2007 and a new way to reach potential customers Hsu and Lin 2008 Librarian blogs serve as new information channels both for the library and information science community and for the general public Bar Ilan 2007 In education blogs can help students to share their learning experiences express their thoughts to the instructor Maag 2005 and enhance their studies Kim et al in press Journalists regard blogs as alternative sources of news and public opinion Lasica 2001 In the political context blogs as possessing a social transformative democratizing potential claimed Herring et al 2004 and Walker 2007 called blogs a soapbox and highlighted their attractiveness for voicing political messages Nowadays blogging tools provide enhanced features for between blog interactivity thus promoting the creation of social networks among bloggers Du and Wagner 2006 Williams Jacobs 2004 recognized interactivity as the key to the success of social network systems such as blogs Interactivity between blogs take two forms The first form is that of a blogroll that many bloggers maintain It is a list of blogs that bloggers frequently read or especially admire The second form is achieved by expressing their thoughts by posting comments to entries Drezner and Farrell 2004 Mishne Glance 2006 Posts commenting on posts are a key form of information exchange in the blogosphere Drezner and Farrell 2004 highlighted the fact that links and page views are the currency of the blogoshpere Forty percent of the Greek population uses Internet Percentages are higher among young people and men Search for information sending emails downloading playing games chatting and online buying are the reasons for using internet Using a sample of 1367 bloggers Karampasis 2007 http ereuna wordpress com found out that blogging started to expand during 2002 2003 in Greece There exist 9510 blogs written in Greek but only 4639 of them are active The average Greek blogger is around 30 with college education S he uses DSL connection Blogs receive less than 100 visits daily while they do not have any advertisements and they discuss multiple subjects Bloggers are 64 male 65 of the bloggers live in Athens 53 1 and Thessaloniki 12 4 Eleven percent is residents of abroad Motives for blogging are keeping a diary experimenting taking action while being anonymous 3 creation of a community Personal interests art and culture and entertainment are the main subjects throughout Greek blogs News and politics blogs are rarer Thirty eight percent of the bloggers consider blogging to be a form of journalism while 51 does not The paper aims to describe basic characteristics of political blogging in Greece using at large their quantitative properties It examines the posts of blogs that were pros or cons the two main candidates of the election for presidency of Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement PASOK for the period from September 16 to November 13 Blogs connectivity closeness variations over time and skewedness of the blog incoming links distribution are the main characteristics of this investigation Political Blogging Βlogs have been seen a good way of circulating new ideas Baker and Green 2005 and featured in articles regarding their political activism and influence Su et al 2005 The interest within the political sphere on bloggers is that they are a potential alternative to the traditional media as gatekeepers of information and news mentioned Pedley 2005 p 295 Johnson and Kaye 2004 claimed that weblogs were viewed by web users as a credible source which provided depth and thoughtful analysis and based on this Jackson 2006 p 295 suggest that during an election campaign a weblog is a mean for a party to promulgate its policies through a virtual network of political bloggers Talking more generally Trammell et al 2006 noted that blogs are a popular tool for politicians to campaign and reach out to their constituency and Graf and Darr 2004 that blogs appear to play an increasingly important role as a forum of public debate with knock on consequences for the media and for politics Commenting on political blogs into American politics Graf 2006 wrote In just a few years they have become a finger in the eye of the mainstream media and a closely watched forum of political debate Political blogs have exposed lapses in mainstream media coverage chastened reporters with the fear of an angry online response to sensitive stories and at times set the media agenda Political blogs have also been influential in raising money for political candidates and pushing select races into the national spotlight Investigating political blogs for campaigns Garrett 2004 in Trammell et al 2006 mentioned that bloggers write posts in a personal voice update the blogs several times a day encourage and moderate comments offer hyperlinks to internal and external sources and other blogs and call the readers into action As far as visitors of political blogs in USA is concerned Bloom 2003 mentioned that a high percentage are political reporters politicians and policy makers key opinion formers Taking this in to consideration Jackson 2006 p 296 mentioned This can give political bloggers a disproportionate influence based on the type of blog visitor and not just the number of blog visitors Therefore elite bloggers can act as a focal point encouraging influential visitors to congregate around them To influence the news political and policy agenda political actors need to attract an A list audience to their weblog It was Drezner and Farrell 2004 who found out that even though there are over a million bloggers posting thousands of new items daily the median blogger has almost no political influence as measured by traffic or hyperlinks and they highlighted This is because the distribution of weblinks and traffic is heavily skewed with a few bloggers commanding most of the attention This distribution parallels the one observed for political websites in general 4 Because of this distribution a few elite blogs can operate as both an information aggregator and as a summary statistic for the blogoshpere p 4 The most reliable way to gain traffic to a blog is through a link on another weblog Blood 2002 In that way blogs with large numbers of incoming links offer both a means of filtering interesting blog posts from less interesting ones and a focal point at which bloggers with interesting posts and potential readers of these posts can coordinate Drezner and Farrell 2004 p 13 Less prominent bloggers contact one of the large focal point blogs to publicize their post when they have an interesting piece of information or point of view that is relevant to a political controversy On the one hand this lead the readers to focal point blogs as they know that they will find links to many interesting stories and on the other hand bloggers to send posts to focal point blogs as they know that they are likely to find more readers Based on this and the lognormal distribution of weblogs in a given a political issue the media only needs to look at the top blogs to obtain a summary statistic about the distribution of opinions Drezner and Farrell In this vein Adamic and Glance 2005 p 2 noted Because of bloggers ability to identify and frame breaking news many mainstream media sources keep a close eye on the best known political blogs Methodology The paper aims to describe basic characteristics of political blogging in Greece using at large their quantitative properties It uses technorati com to track Greek political blogs and provide indicators of their popularity and interconnections As a case study the paper considers the recent debate that took place on the Web relatively to the election of PASOK s new President Pan Hellenic Socialist Movement PASOK one of the two major parties in Greece under Georgos Papandreou s leadership was defeated on the national election of September 16 2007 and this defeat brought up a major leadership crisis Election for a new leader was held on November 11 2007 The paper examines the posts of blogs that were pros or cons the two main candidates for presidency for the period from September 16 to November 13 Technorati com search engine is used to search for all blog posts that link to the sites or blogs of the two main candidates for presidency of PASOK G Papandreou and E Venizelos for the period 16 9 13 11 2007 It presents and measures blogs connectivity conversational patterns and variations over time The paper adds to the study of political blogs by reporting patterns of blogging and making one of the few contributions to the study of political blogging in Greece The study uses Social Networking theory to present and study blogs Blogs connectivity closeness and variations over time are the main characteristics of this investigation In addition the paper discusses skewedness of the blog incoming links distribution and how this is affecting the formation of central or core blog groups which serve as focal point blogs Drezner and Farrell 2004 Multidimensional scaling and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis are used to explore blog patterns regarding connectivity Also the paper uses measures of closeness of core groups in order to examine whether blog groups political affiliation is reflected to blogs interconnections Findings Through the search via technorati com 142 blogs were found Figure 1 presents the variations over time for blog posts linking to Papandreou s the former 5 and current president of the party site blog Figure 2 presents the variations over time for blog posts linking to Venizelos site blog Posts linking to Papandreou are more uniformly distributed However the distribution of blog posts linking to Venizelos is more interesting The discussion about the new contender attracted more attention from bloggers and Venizelos was criticised and discussed widely This is the reason that the blog posts present a higher density in the left side of their distribution reflecting the discussion at the beginning of the re election period 9 8 8 7 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 3 2 2 1 4 4 3 2 2 1 2 3 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 3 4 3 2 2 1 4 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 3

40 41 Figure 2 Variations over time for blog posts linking to Venizelos site blog 6 In order to explore the connectivity patterns of political blogs the paper uses the social networking theory The next step involves the presentation of the 142 blogs using a graph UCINET 6 0 for Windows is used for this presentation Figure 3 presents the interconnections of the 142 blogs As Drezner and Farrell 2004 p 13 mention Blogs with large numbers of incoming links offer both a means of filtering interesting blog posts from less interesting ones and a focal point at which bloggers with interesting posts and potential readers of these posts can coordinate When less prominent bloggers have an interesting piece of information or point of view that is relevant to a political controversy they will usually post this on their own blogs However they will also often have an incentive to contact one of the large focal point blogs to publicize their post The latter may post on the issue with a hyperlink back to the original blog if the story or point of view is interesting enough so that the originator of the piece of information receives more readers In this manner bloggers with fewer links function as fire alarms for focal point blogs providing new information and links Also they mention that We note that this implies that even while focal point blogs play a crucial mediating role smaller blogs may sometimes have very substantial political impact by bringing information to the attention of focal blogs Drezner and Farrell 2004 p 13 This paper argues that focal point blogs are recognized as authority blogs by the bloggers community and they may serve as the blogs cores where the interesting and informational discussion is taking place This property can be used to limit the analysis only to these blogs excluding in this way other blogs which might be considered to have limited interconnections with other blogs or they are isolated This property is a consequence of the skewed distribution of links also mentioned by Drezner and Farrell 2004 only few blogs have a very big number of incoming links while the rest the majority of blogs have only a small number of incoming links To test whether this hypothesis holds for political blogging in Greece this paper examines the distribution of incoming links to the 142 blogs of the study To measure incoming links for a blog the paper calculates the percentage of the 142 blogs that link to it For example a percentage of 10 for a specific blog means that nearly 14 out of 142 blogs link to it Figure 3 presents the histogram of incoming links for the 142 blogs Most of the blogs have a very small number of incoming links while only a few blogs have a big number of incoming links In any case the percentage of incoming links does not exceed 17 Blogs have a very low degree of interconnectivity and this is due mainly to the fact that most blogs are constructed in an amateur fashion or they were built just for campaigning the two main candidates Figure 4 presents similar findings It presents blog ranks according to incoming links 1 being the highest linked blog versus the percentage of incoming links From both Figure 3 and Figure 4 it is obvious that there exist a skewed distribution which implies that only a few blogs gather the highest number of incoming links This finding provides evidence that Drezner and Farrell s 2004 argument about the skewedness of incoming links distribution holds true 7 75 on Cut 50 25 0 0 00 4 00 8 00 12 0 0 incoming_links Figure 3 Histogram of percentages of

Figure 5 Blogs interconnections according to incoming links from blog rolls The next step involves the construction of a blog interconnection graph It is a directed graph where blogs are noted as nodes and incoming links as directed arrows Figure 5 One can notice that there exist a central area of the graph where it seems that two core networks are formed which they gather most of the incoming links To describe this situation explicitly statistical analysis using Multidimensional Scaling Stress 0 03039 followed by Hierarchical Cluster Analysis is performed It results to the formation of three groups clusters of blogs regarding incoming links These groups of blogs are described in Table 1 Table 1 Blog groups description Affiliation Group 1 6 blogs Group 2 17 blogs Group 3 119 blogs Pro Papandreou Non political political but with no PASOK affiliation critical to both candidates and especially to Venizelos All the rest of the blogs 9 Mean percentage of incoming links 10 7 1 From Table 1 it is clear that Group 1 contains blogs which are pro Papandreou Their administrator is mainly a member of PASOK The average percentage of blogs in 142 total linking to this Group is 10 Group 2 consists of non political non PASOK though political or critical blogs to both candidates The average percentage of incoming links is 7 In conclusion the average percentage of incoming links is relatively low to both groups The large number of non political blogs or the temporary character by means that they were constructed for campaign reasons or the amateur fashion of constructing a blog may serve as reasons for this Groups 3 contain all the rest of the blogs They have a very small number of incoming links 1 and they are distinguished from the two core Groups Formation of groups is a finding which is also compatible with those founded by Drezner and Farrell s 2004 Further the analysis searches for closeness of the core groups Groups 1 and 2 Closeness describes the property of a group of blogs where on the one hand there exist a large number of interconnections of blogs within the group and on the other hand there exists only a small number of links between blogs of this particular group and any other group of blogs In the present study this means that there exists a large number of interconnections within Group 1 and Group 2 but only a small number of links between blogs of Group 1 linking to blogs of Group 2 and vice versa Table 2 presents the mean percentages of links within each core group linking to Group 1 or Group 2 For each blog the percentage of incoming links is calculated Then the average percentage for each core group is obtained Table 2 shows that the average blog of Group 1 is linked by 55 6 of the blogs of Group 1 while the average blog of Group 2 is linked by only 11 76 of the blogs of Group 1 On the other hand the average blog in Group 2 is linked by 25 of the blogs of Group 2 and by 16 7 of Group 1 Group1 exhibits a higher degree of closeness while Group 2 presents low degrees of linkage to both groups of blogs Table 3 goes a step further since it presents the percentages of degree of connection within each core group and between them as well Two groups are in connection if any blog of one group links to any blog of the other Degree of connection for a group can be calculated as the percentage of blogs linking to any blog of it From Table 3 it is clear that 83 3 of blogs in Group 1 are linked by at least one blog of Group 1 Half of the blogs of Group 2 are linked by at least one of the blogs of Group 1 and half of the blogs from both Group 1 and 2 are linked by at least one blog from Group 1 On the other hand 76 5 of the blogs of Group 2 are linked by blogs of Group 2 23 5 of the blogs of Group 2 are linked by blogs from Group 1 and 23 5 of blogs from both groups are linked by blogs from Group 2 In conclusion the two core groups are characterized by a high degree of closeness yet there exist enough interconnections between the two groups Closeness is significant but not absolute Table 2 Mean percentages of links within each group linking to blogs of Groups 1 and 2 Group 1 6 blogs Group 2 17 blogs Group 1 6 blogs 55 6 11 76 Group 2 17 blogs 16 7 25 Group 3 119 blogs 7 5 4 10 Table 3 Degrees of connections to Groups 1 and 2 Group 1 Group 2 Group 1 6 blogs Group 2 17 blogs Group 3 119 blogs 83 3 23 5 19 5 50 76 5 27 1 Both Groups 1 and 2 50 23 5 11 Conclusions Political blogging in Greece although limited conforms to the characteristics described in the literature regarding political blogging Political discussion through blogs is influencing media but also they influence it as well As Drezner and Farrell 2004 conclude that blogs may frame political debates and create focal points for the media as a whole In this way blogs sometimes have real political consequences given the relatively low number of blog readers in the overall population Skewedness of incoming links distribution and the formation of core blog groups may be used to explain the importance that some blogs have on the provision of information and discussion Empirical evidence from Drezner and Farrell 2004 is also reproduced in the present analysis Greek political blogs act within a social network of blogs which form authority core groups where the discussion is taking place These core blog groups provide citizens opinions and attitudes which are taken into consideration by media Recently for example there are plenty of published articles in Greek newspapers referring blog posts Political affiliation is partly reflected on the formation of blog core groups Because of this it is easier for citizens to coordinate and find out were the interesting debate is taking place This paper made an effort to describe the mathematical properties of political blogging in Greece by means of connectivity and closeness It strived to apply recent advances in political blogging research being one of
