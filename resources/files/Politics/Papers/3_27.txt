Webforum design and debate practices during the 2007 French presidential campaign Nicolas Desquinabo nicodeski yahoo fr Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle CIM Paris France Politics Web 2 0 An International Conference New Political Communication Unit Department of Politics and International Relations Royal Holloway University of London April 17 18 2008 Abstract During the last French presidential election online forums have become a major place of political debate In order to evaluate the impact of the institutional design Wright 2006 on citizen deliberations we wanted to work on three questions What were the level of participation and interactivity of these debates What types of online debates were practiced during this campaign What was the impact of interface and institutional designs on debate features Our corpus is made of threads produced on five forums desirsdavenir org Ségolène Royal jeunespopulaires com Nicolas Sarkozy UDF org François Bayrou orange fr a portal site and forum politique org a specialized site We first analysed the global participation and the level of interactivity of all the threads produced between November 2006 and April 2007 Then we have selected a sample of political debate threads from each site in order to characterize the pragmatic features of the interactions Activism organisation site problem and leisure discussions have not been observed We analysed the types of speech acts the argumentative devices and the links between the messages of approximately 100 threads Finally we have used descriptive and multidimensional statistics in order to characterize and quantify the different types of debates observed proposal debate election forecast dispute candidates attacks etc After Needham 2004 or Wright 2006 our results point out the influence of institutional instructions on debate forms The availability of status cues also seems to have specific effects on debates as shown in the computer mediated groups studies Lemus al 2004 Key words forum online deliberation citizen institutional design 1 Introduction After a period of intense theorization empirical studies of actual political debates between citizens begin to test the ideal of a deliberative democracy Fishkin 1995 Gutmann Thompson 1996 Dahlgren 2003 Studies of the democratisation of political practice show a rather weak and non representative citizen participation to public debates whether they are face to face Blondiaux 2000 Delli Carpini al 2004 or online Mulhberger 2004 Wojcik 2005 Oates Gibson 2006 The observation of debate practices in newsgroups Vedel 2002 Davis 2005 and political party forums Serfaty 2002 Marcoccia 2006 show a high proportion of short messages numerous personal attacks and a high concentration of participation Beyond these common points observed variations suggest an influence of the interface design and more generally of the institutional design on online debate 1 practices Wright 2006 As an example highly facilitated forums with self selected Weiksner 2005 Beierle 2004 or randomly selected participants Price al 2002 Iyengar al 2003 have shown that respectful and argumentative debates can occur more frequently and have important impacts on political knowledge or opinion change In order to contribute to the empirical work on this question we have studied a sample of political debates produced on the forums of UDF org François Bayrou s party web site jeunespopulaires com youth organization s web site of Nicolas Sarkozy s party desirsdavenir org Ségolène Royal s web site forum politique org the most active French web forum specialized on politics and orange fr one of the major French portal web site Before presenting the main results of this study we will first describe the architecture of these forums and present our estimation of the debates participation and interactivity during the six month prior to the first round of the French presidential election between November 2006 and April 2007 2 Architectures of the forums The five forums studied are moderated and asynchronous devices of message exchange The forums of desirsdavenir org DA jeunespopualires fr JP and orange fr are moderated a priori although the forums of udf org UDF and forum politique org FP are moderated a posteriori The architecture of DA forums contrasts with the others on different dimensions forums general organization number durability instructions available information on participants and visual presentation of the threads 2 1 General organisation of the forums UDF JP and FP forums use the same classical software php BB which offers a more or less restraint number of permanent forums These forums are not introduced and defined by wide themes FP has 17 political forums while JP and UDF only offer 3 and 5 forums on political debate Orange uses a specific interface with several categories of forums society finance informatics sports music etc At least 26 forums are clearly dedicated to political debate 14 forums in the category Society and 12 in the categories World Ecology Employment and Education A different interface is used by DA web site the freeware Phorum that offers more than 150 forums on precise themes usually introduced by the candidate s questions or suggestions Table 1 UDF JP FP Orange and DA forums general organization UDF Society Economy International Institutions Project forum Party life The web site Jeunes Populaires France International Debates with party official In federations Party life Chat section Forum Politique Orange Désirs d Avenir Presidential election 10 French politics 6 International Affairs 7 Life of ideas 4 Technical 2 Activists 14 Society 6 World 5 Ecology 3 Employment 3 Education 14 Travels 11 Informatics 10 Sports etc 100 Presidential treaty forums 7 Participative debates 15 Other debates 12 Current events 33 Local forums Supporters forum Some DA forums have been limited in time by Ségolène Royal participative campaign during which the candidate was explicitly asking for citizen s suggestions in order to enrich 2 or amend her program DA debate forums are generally introduced by a text signed by the candidate For instance the introductive texts of the first participative debate present a diagnostic some political goals and ask three or four questions that are opening a discussion thread With these starting messages the Internet users are asked to evaluate several suggestions of public policies and to produce new proposals For example one of the threads about education is introduced by is it necessary to consider school support an assignment to public education as done in several northern European countries These solicitations exemplify the candidate general appeal to the citizen participation to her presidential program widely heard in traditional media 2 2 Thread information operation and presentation DA and Orange forums distinguished from UDF JP and FP forums by available information possible operations and visual presentations of threads In these three forums a lot of general information is available from the front page number of threads and messages of each forum number of replies and views for each thread user name and number of users on the web site and on each forum etc On thread pages there is more or less detailed information about the authors of the messages number of messages seniority location websites etc On the contrary DA and Orange forums interface does not give any type of information about participants and very little information about forums and threads However the five forums offer a quite elaborated message browser by theme and or by author Table 2 Main interface features of forums UDF Main Page information Forum Page information Thread Page information Visual Presentation of threads Author profile information Research possibilities Jeunes Forum Politique Orange Populaires Nbr of threads and messages per forum Nbr of threads

name Threaded mode Date of registration Nbr of messages of the total messages Nbr of messages per day No profile information Link all messages of author Contacts Research by key word in the title or in the message Research by author List of members 3 The visual presentation of UDF JP FP and Orange uses the linear mode although DA uses the strict threaded mode With the linear mode it is easier to have a quick look at the general description of the threads on a first page and then read the messages one after another without a click As we can see in figure 1 the threaded mode of DA looks like the Usenet forums and is less common on French web This display mode shows more clearly the address of a message but hinder the list of threads Furthermore it is not possible to see more than one message per page on the interface of DA although it is possible to see from twenty to thirty messages per page in the other display mode Subject Evaluation Nuclear isn t the solution by archimède the

Through these different architectures the Internet users debate since August of 2002 for FP February of 2003 for UDF April of 2004 for Orange November of 2005 for JP and February of 2006 for DA In order to describe the use of these devices of online discussion during the presidential campaign we first analysed several participation indicators 3 Participation and interactivity of the forums A lot of general information about participation is available on the four forums but these data have different disadvantages periods are not equivalent nothing is said on the participation concentration and parties have electoral incentives to exaggerate these data For these reasons we analysed all the thread pages of the five websites in order to specify the intensity interactivity and concentration of the discussion participation between October 15th of 2006 and April 15th of 2007 This analysis has been run on political forums We have not studied the other technical militant or leisure forums approximately 18 of UDF messages and 45 of JP 25 of FP 40 of Orange and 30 of DA messages Table 3 Participation between November of 2006 and April of 2007 UDF Number of messages Number of threads Average size of threads 25 614 Jeunes Populaires 33 168 Forum Politique 98 755 112 000 Désirs d avenir 48 000 1842 1413 3686 28 000 13 000 14 23 27 4 4 4 Orange As we can see in table 3 the participation to DA and Orange forums has been wide1 but with far less interactivity In table 4 the atypical lengths of DA thread appears clearly many very short and a few very long threads coexist Two threads started by the candidate exceed 1000 messages Table 4 Distribution of messages by size of thread in Size of threads 1 10 11 20 21 50 51 100 101 200 200 UDF Jeunes Populaires Forum Politique Orange Désirs d avenir 17 20 31 15 8 9 100 25 614 8 15 37 23 11 6 100 33 168 8 8 24 25 21 14 100 98 755 56 16 20 6 1 1 100 112 000 62 14 5 3 2 14 100 48 000 Running out of time we have not estimated the number of participants on similar periods Nevertheless it is interesting to note that since the beginning of the forums the number of registered users announced is almost the same for the forums of UDF 5535 FP 5039 and JP 3987 DA announced an approximate number of 50 000 posters and Orange does not display this type of information Concerning the concentration of participation the twenty most active users have posted more than 50 of messages on FP more than 40 on JP approximately 30 on UDF and only 7 on DA 4 Pragmatic and argumentative features of debates To describe the type of debates and quantify their frequency we have run a second analysis that specifies the pragmatic and argumentative characteristics of a sample of 104 threads 975 messages 4 1 Sampling procedure This sample has been selected with a stratified random procedure in order to avoid the bias linked to the thread titles and our political interests The 200 selected messages per website are as representative as possible of the total population by size of thread periods and variety of forums We have systematically selected The first threads of less than 10 messages of the 1st day of each month The first thread between 10 and 20 messages of the 10th day of each month And the longest threads between the 20th and the end of each month 1 These figures are an approximation for DA because of the inaccurate representation of short threads on the interface and are a sample based estimation for Orange because of the high number of threads Morevoer we have not studied the political discussions that sometimes occurr in forums which are not explcitely political supporters religion chat etc 5 We derogate from our rule three times for the UDF and JP forums in order to select at least one thread of more than 10 messages thematically comparable to the other forums Considering the specific structure of DA threads we have over represented the messages included in long thread with the intention of analyzing at least one by popular thematic economy education justice and ecology For all forums we have only analysed the twenty to twenty five first messages of the long threads for obvious reasons of feasibility 4 2 Analysis variables Our analysis is based on several pragmatic and argumentative variables Desquinabo 2007 which come from the pragmatic tradition and especially from Charaudeau 1995 and Chabrol and Bromberg s 1999 classification inform compare explain exemplify quote evaluate agree or disagree the interlocutor speech forecast conduce dissuade compliment blame refute or admit a fault defend someone joke make fun approve or contest speech practices theme style speech acts etc We have detailed the type of content of some of these speech acts in order to account more precisely for the types of debates practiced We have encoded specifically Argumentation founded on consequences Perelman 2002 and argumentation founded on experience Blame or compliment addressed to interlocutors groups teachers strangers etc or politicians Incentives to vote for and against a candidate Proposal of general goal and proposal of specific policies We also differentiate the given speech acts to inform from the asked one to ask for an information and from the replies to accept to give an information Among the different linked between speech acts of a given interlocutor Roulet al 2001 we have coded the argumentative and contra argumentative links These analysis categories are exemplified in the figure n 3 extracted from a thread of DA Fewer cars more trains Message of jerome67 the 05 02 07 at 21 31 MESSAGE 104 Identity Hello Civility Today if you are two or three in a car it s cheaper than train It would be useful to program a wide policy to reduce the price of train tramway and underground ticket in order to conduce the road users to join the rail Justification of the Policy Proposal by a Comparison Policy Proposal Justification of the Policy Proposal by its Consequences Figure 2 Example of a message analysis 4 3 Types of debates Thereby we analysed 975 messages coming from 104 threads produced between November 2006 and April 2007 We will present the main results of different statistic analysis produced with the software Lexico 3 of the Syled Cla2t Université de la Sorbonne Nouvelle Paris 3 We first compared the pragmatic and argumentative practices of the debate threads more 6 than 3 messages In order to explore the relationships between our variables we first used a factor analysis of our sample of threads The two main factors found differentiate three sets of threads The analysis of the statistical specificities of these sets describes three types of speech activities more or less practiced according to the web sites value debate dispute election forecast and candidate support The most frequent type of speech activity can be called value debate 34 of the threads This kind of thread is mostly coming from DA UDF and Orange This type of debate is characterized by argued and controversial proposals of general values or public policies The argumentations are mostly founded on information The progress of teaching in France during the last century is demonstrated by a study on the different adults skills according to their age UDF Society forum The argumentations are also based on plausible consequences For the merchandise traffic more piggyback will allow to reduce our energetic bill and our carbon emission DA Environment forum The posted messages are relatively long between 500 and 800 signs for most of them Personal attacks between authors are rare but attacks against groups elected trade unionist teachers etc are quite frequent The second type of speech activity observed is the dispute 29 of the threads This kind of threads is mainly produced on the JP and the UDF forums Attacks against political adversaries are generally responded by supports of the attacked personalities in short messages between 50 and 200 signs These debates often result in personal disputes between the discussants sometimes with teases sometimes with insults A typical message of dispute is the following On this topic I understand Royal to live with the people Paris north east is horrible Besides that s what Sarkozy is doing with Neuilly So please stop put this kind of things in light if you don t want the Left using it You make me think about Pecress doing this lousy counterproductive JP France forum The third type of speech activity can be called political chat 26 of threads This activity is mainly represented in our sample of FP and Orange threads In this type of debate a few Internet users exchange forecasts general attitudes about candidates and jokes Quotation is widely used in very short messages of 50 to 100 signs For instance in a thread of the Presidential election forum of FP Pedrovikash quote and disagree Atlantiste with his forecast and make fun of him at the same time Atlantiste had written Sarkozy is the next president of the republic It s written Pedrovikash The most important thing is to believe it An analysis centred on the five forums confirms the results of the thread analysis The UDF and Orange messages have many similar features the frequency of candidate attacks election forecasts conceding and argumentations based on quotations The messages posted on FP are the shortest and generally have a double quotation a candidate attack a joke and a signature about general principles The messages on JP are generally short and are characterized by general evaluations interlocutor quotations disagreement and attacks of candidates groups or forum users Finally the DA messages are the longest and have a high proportion of policy proposals which use an argumentation based on plausible consequences 7 5 Conclusion Globally the forums analysed have had very active debates during the last presidential campaign But in accordance with the classical observation on the digital divide Muhlberger 2004 much of the messages have been posted by a small number of participants Nevertheless our results confirm that the exchanges on the Internet are full of conflicts but these clashes are not bounded to polemical exchanges and therefore suggest a potential impact of the Internet on a possible deliberative disagreement Gutmann Thompson 1996 generally avoided in assemblies at which citizens are present Elisasoph 1998 If our study did not compare online debates with debates where people are physically present it seems likely that the characteristics of the device no physical presence limited identity cues written asynchronous with hyperlinks etc could encourage a more controversial participation and a more sustained and elaborated argumentation than in faceto face situations Witschge 2004 The device impacts have been showed by many researches in the computer mediated groups field Lemus al 2004 which attribute most differences between face to face and online argumentativeness to the degree of availability of status indications Our results confirm this hypothesis As a matter of fact the forums giving more information on participants social status and participants seniority on website and pushing more to private communication FP and JP are the one whose participation are the most concentrated and whose exchanges are the less argued But this factor is not systematically related to the quality of debates as shown by the analysis of Orange forums The deliberative features of DA threads are also probably linked with the specific institutional frame of this forum DA was supposed to be a participative forum and Ségolène Royal explicitly solicited argued policy proposals Moreover this appeal to citizen participation to her presidential program has been widely heard in traditional media This likelihood of political influence factor Blondiaux Sintomer 2002 Hartz Karp 2005 has certainly been central to motivate participation and frame the debates Therefore it seems likely that even if the Internet does not encourage per se controversial and sustained debates some institutional systems and technical devices can encourage them Thus after George 2002 Bekkers 2004 Needham 2004 or Wright 2006 our study suggests that the institutional frame of online discussions strongly influences their characteristics We should now specify this link what kinds of influences have interface information Threads presentation Moderators role Likelihood of political influence These hypotheses will have to be tested on other web forums in different political contexts in order to deepen our knowledge of the constraints practices and potentials of online debate References BEIERLE T C 2004 Digital
