PhD Universitat Ramon Llull Barcelona Catalunya josepsort mac com josepsj blanquerna edu THE RISE OF CATOSFERA A CASE STUDY OF CATALAN BLOGOSPHERE Abstract For Catosfera we understand the community formed by all the blogs written in Catalan or the Catalan written part of the global blogosphere It is commonly accepted that in the last years the rise of Catosfera has been very important In this paper I propose to study the roots of this trend A first consideration is that even though Catalan is a lesser used language the number of blogs written in Catalan is relatively high In relatively terms Catalan is one of the languages more used in the blogosphere Secondly if we divide the catosfera by themes it is interesting to realize that political blogs are paramount following by literary and technolgy blogs This hegemony of politics in the catosfera can be explained by the late political developments in the Catalan political life debate on Independence versus Autonomy What is shocking is that this online activism is parallel to a drop of political engagement in offline politics such as voting in elections and referenda In the proposed paper I discuss the implications of this paradox Also I suggest other reason to understand the rise of the catosfera not related to politics Such reasons are i inexistance of a referential publication newspaper weekly biweekly monthly written in Catalan and the Media hostility perception debate ii the rise of the short articles style called bitllets iii a very rich tradition of Catalan journalism iv The Hostile Media Perception thesis KEYWORDS INTERNET NATIONALISM ONLINE ACTIVISM POLITICAL BLOGS MINORITY LANGUAGES CULTURAL DIVERSITY THE RISE OF CATOSFERA A CASE STUDY OF CATALAN BLOGOSPHERE 1 The Blogosphere A New Political Opportunity Structure In the last years a strong explosion of the blogosphere had occurred mainly in the United States but also all over the world It is a phenomenon that has already deserved an important and growing volume of academic analysis and interest BLOOD 2002 DREZNER FARRELL 2004 McKENNA POOLE 2004 DAVIS 2005 CHADWICK 2006 TREMAYNE 2007 PERLMUTTER 2008 The blogosphere from the political communication point of view has become a new interaction channel that multiplies the chances to issue and receive inputs to debate and to participate in the decision making process It helps to democratize the public debate primarily in those societies where a significant number of citizens not only have basic skills such as reading and writing but also are digital literate and have access to the net The opportunity to address oneself to the world apparently without mediators and at an almost null economic cost has attracted many citizens activists organizations and groups that use the Net in order to reach levels of attention and or support unthinkable otherways due to lack of human or material resources for example From this point of view we can see the blogosphere as a new opportunity structure or more specifically as a new political opportunity structure meaning that it allows those that feel alienated in political terms from mainstream media and main political actors to spread their ideas points of views stands and eventually to gain supports As a consequence bloggers virtual communities formed by blog writers but also by readers and commentators have grown not only quantitatively but also in a quality way that is in influence SROKA 2006 As a matter of fact top ranked bloggers tend to be taken into account by politicians candidates communications directors and invited them in some of the most important political events such as primaries campaigns assemblies and so on AIRA SORT 2007 2 Also traditional media that is press radio and television outlets have incorporated bloggers as an offer to their consumers In this sense the bloggers contribution is seen as an added value that complements the traditional offer However one of the most evident elements of the blogosphere is the linguistic one Blogs are written in one language or in some cases there are bilingual examples So in order to write read them people must proof its proficiency in the language Of course English language is preeminent in the global blogosphere but as a matter of fact others languages have taken profit from it Particularly blogosphere has benefited those minority or lesser used languages that face troubles in order to be incorporated in more expensive communication channels such as the traditional ones Thanks to the low cost of writting and access a blog people who share a same language or are capable to read it now can communicate each other with independence of their geographical location In this sense the blogosphere helps to preserve and most important to promote cultural and linguistic diversity On the other hand the growing number of online translation services in spite of the errors and de adjustements that they often have helps to break the danger of isolation of each linguistic blogger community so we cannot see the global blogosphere as a number of closed communities The exchange of communication and opinion between different linguistic blogospheres is posible even the writer the reader or the commentator do not know a single word in the other language provide there is an offer in translation services between his or her native language and the other language of course 2 The Catalan Language at the Blogosphere The Catosfera The word Catosfera was first used by Toni Ibáñez in his post Qualtitat posted at his now defunct blog Tros de Quòniam http trosdequoniam blogspot com in 06 01 2005 and refers to the set of all the blogs written in Catalan and to the virtual community that exists around these blogs including those people who post articles those who read 3 them and those who comment them 1 The relevant Catosfera s feature then is the use of the Catalan as the main language As a consequence the author s reader s or commentator s geographical location does not have any significance at all In this sense the Catosfera is global since it is not attached to a concrete place It can be written readed or commentated in the Catalan speaking territories from now on Catalan Countries or in Singapur Tokyo London or L A On the contrary those blogs written by authors located in the Catalan Countries in other languages such as Spanish French Italian or English but also in any of the dozens of languages currently spoken in the Catalan Countries as a consequence of recent and huge migratory movements from all around the world are not considered in principle part of the Catosfera It is also rejected to consider as some academic papers do the Catosfera as a subset of the whole Hispanic blogosphere or Spanish blogosphere TRICAS RUIZMERELO 2003 because it obey clearly to different dynamics specially when Latin Americans blogs are also include In other words Catosfera has grown strongly related to the political social and cultural events and to the public debates they have generated in the Catalan Countries lately That being said Catosfera is not closed to global dynamics which also have an extense impact upon it Quite the contrary some of the most prolific contributors are people living away executives students artists etc who opt to write a blog or to read or comment in Catalan MOLIST 2006 2 1 Data on Catalan Language Given then the centrality of the linguistic element in the definition of the catosfera it is indispensable that we make a brief consideration on the Catalan Language Later demolinguistics estimations show that Catalan ranks 88 in the list of World Languages other estimations however placed it in 92 As TABLE 1 establishes there are about 6 milions catalan native people but the number of total catalan speakers 4 reaches more than 9 5 milions This gap is explained thanks to the linguistic integration of part of the Spanish and Galician speaking population that immigrate to the Catalan Countries between 1950 and 1975 approximately The integration was more important in 2nd and 3rd generations rather than first however TABLE 1

speaking but about writting and reading we have to focus our attention to those able in one or both these abilities As the Table shows 9 368 000 people read catalan and 6 101 600 write it To these totals we must add those expats that count for about 350 000 If we put these figures in an European context they show that Catalan has a potential presence in the blogosphere higher than other europeans official languages such as slovenian slovakian danish norwegian or finish and similar to Swedish 3 The Evolution of Catosfera Even though there were some blogs in Catalan previously Catosfera started to develop from in 2003 and attained media and popular attention between 2005 and 2006 It appears then with a certain delay with respecte to the US case but goes parallel to many cases in Europe Trigger factors that explain its development are both global and domestic 5 One first factor was the activism against War in Afganistan and Iraq when more than one milion people demonstrated in Barcelona streets The protest was not only off line but also on line and blogger were at the vanguard of the opposition In 2004 two events increased the blogger revolution in Catalonia The 11 3 Madrid train bombings and lately the impact of American presidential campaign when american bloggers first received a worldwide attention But if the global agenda was very important to the rise of Catosfera the domestic agenda was not less relevant Between 2003 and 2006 Catalonia politics were shocked by important changes that spread the need among activist people to express politically And they find the new ICT a suitable tool to do it The most relevants of such changes were the following 1 Following November 2003 Catalan elections the incumbent party was defeated after 23 years in office In a certain sense a new era started even though the new President was by no means a fresh politician since he has been the 1992 Olympic Games Mayor of Barcelona 2 In March 2004 Spanish elections were held under the sad impact of the Madrid bombings and the mobile revolution when millions of people ask the incumbent government for transparent information Its crisis mismanagement doomed it to defeat 3 The European elections June 2004 and especially the debate on European Constitution referendum February 2005 focused on the status reserved to Catalonia as a nation and the Catalan language recognition as an official language 4 And lastly but by no means less important quite the contrary all the talks and dealings about the reform of the different Statutes of Autonomy but mainly the one of Catalonia which started in September of 2005 and lasted until the celebration of the corresponding referendum of confirmation which took place in June of 2006 All these episodes that monopolized the political debate foster the expansion of the 6 Catosfera In January 2005 a first empirical estimation established that about 8 000 blogs in Catalan have been created many of them were short lived But the rise was not only quantitative but also qualitative Although initially political blogs shared protagonism with technological literary and personal ones they grew faster in number in the period 2005 06 to the point that we can speak of a true catosfera hyperpolitization from the thematic point of view political blogs be they activists or more academic become preeminent although this trend seems apparently to slowdown in 2007 08 Political and Electoral Literary Technology Sports Education Cinema and Music Fotoblocs Blog Editors TOTAL TABLE 2 BLOGS REGISTERED Accessed

Table 2 we can see the thematic distribution of those blogs registered at Catalan Government webpage The registrarion is not compulsory and free of charge As stated Political and Electoral blogs represent more than 50 of the whole group To sum up then the Catosfera has a very distinguishable political profile This assumption contrasts clearly with the fact that in the same period of the Catosfera rising of citizen involvement in online politics or activism we assist to a significant decrease of the citizenry participation in elections and referenda that is in off line politics As TABLE 3 shows the citizens participation dropped significantly between 2003 and 2007 In the 2003 elections to the Catalan Parliament abstention reached 37 46 only in Catalonia 60 2 in the European

next section we provide some clues to understand this contrast between a surge in of political blocs in the catosfera and a drop in political mainly electoral participation ocurred between years 2003 and 2007 approximately Before that however let s discuss Catosfera s most recent evolution Since the second half of 2006 until the whole 2007 right after the Catalan Statute of Autonomy referendum a certain slowdown or relax of blog creation is obvious But there is not a step back only a decrease Also we are attending to a kind of natural selection Some blogs shut down however others not only consolidate but become a referential source and gain momentum in all the Catalan mediasphere including of course the traditional media press radio and television Late estimations consider that only in Catalonia about 100 000 blogs have been created but that only half of them are currently active However to assess the accuracy of these data is difficult so it would be wise to take them with an important dose of relativism CLOS SORT 2007 8 But at the same time the catosfera faces new challenges And one of the more evident are new communication digital tools such as social networks Facebook MySpace podcastings videos You Tube and most lately Twitter In January of 2008 the First Catosfera Conference Jornades de la Catosfera http catosfera net was held in Granollers nearby Barcelona The event was atended by between 250 and 300 bloggers but many more were not allowed in for space and logistics reasons In exchange the sessions were broadcasted in real time and posted in the net For the first time a considerable amount of Catalan bloggers shared in a face toface manner thoughts and criticisms For example the hyperpolitisation of Catosfera was targeted as may be the most negative of their core elements The Conference was a big hit Its webpage was accessed in just one day more than 400 000 times and technological problems did appear However it can be said that the Conference marked the end of the first Catosfera era where a certain amateurism predominated and opened the door of a new era where bloggers are not considered anymore the new kids in the block ARAN SORT 2005 but people with opinion capable to influence in many ways those around them 4 Reasons for the Catosfera As said in this section I suggest some reasons to explain the Catosfera surge and also what has been named the blog generation 2 Four factors must be taken into account 4 1 No referential publications in Catalan language Currently there is a widespread perception that there is no referential publication in Catalan By referential publication I understand a communication channel usually in paper but also in radio and television that gather around him an extense consensus about its quality and authoritative opinion There is no Le Monde no El Pais to take only two examples of succesful newspapers that are able to satisfy the intellectual demands of those people of French and Spanish cultural background Even in Barcelona La Vanguardia newspaper published in Spanish is a well considered product and from time to time there had been movements in order to issue a 9 new edition written in Catalan always failed Due to a sense of cultural orphanhood those people who want to communicate something to their peers opt to publish themselves thanks to the even more more user friendly information and communication technologies and blogs are the perfect tool to reach it 4 2 The rise of very short literary pieces bitllets I think relevant to underline the general acceptance of a new literary genre by current readers that is similar in its length but also in the style and content to an average post In newspapers for example it has been usual to publish very short articles that are known as bitllets tickets not longer than 2000 characters Usually they show some criticism or on the contrary support to something or someone taking sides for or against and not pretending to be neutral at all Another element is that each bitllet focuses in only one issue usally a very concrete one in order to be the most effective a politician statement a mayor decision the author s frustration about his football team a macho episode and so on So in reading blogs you realize that in some cases most of the posts are like bitllets Of course you can find posts longer than 2000 characters but generally speaking bloggers do not want to write larger ones Also posts tend to be very adversarial rejecting neutralism The reason is obvious what you expect from a blogger is authenticity not diplomacy STOCKER 2007 A blogger who sacrifices authenticity in order to gain readers commentaries and money is of zero interest since to pick this you have those journalists that publish in mainstream media An added value of posts vis a vis journalist pieces is of course hipertextuality that allows to link with other posts or webpages In this sense in just one post the reader has access to a lot of documents or sources that he or she can bookmark 4 3 A very rich journalism tradition to emulate Catalan journalism as in others nations has its own referential authors Catalan journalism reach a very important dimension between 1880 and 1939 in parallel to the first development of mass communication ESPINET TRESSERRES 1999 In the thirties for a population of about 2 000 000 people only in Catalonia there were seven national daily newspapers published in Catalan language and a lot more locally The coming of Franco s regime in 1939 saw the prohibition of all of them and marked the hegemony of newspaper written in Spanish only It was not until 1976 that a new 10 Catalan written newspaper Avui was published again Since then the Catalan journalism health has made some progress but we are far away from the rich republican experience Nevertheless Catalan literature has benefited from the works of authors that published not only books but literally thousands of articles and contribute to renew the language Others wrote short stories and essays Some of them are considered like lighthouses for younger generations of writers I am talking about authors like Josep Pla 1897 1981 Manuel de Pedrolo 1918 1990 Joan Fuster 1922 1992 Younger authors such as Quim Monzó 1952 also has some influence Those and others authors are in some cases emulated by the blogger generation particularly literary oriented blogs Since due to the difficulties associated to the dimension of Catalan readership audience it is hard to publish many young and not so young authors opt to open a blog and start to publish Like some music groups the Net has been decisive in the diffusion of new authors that once known by their blogs then have succeded in publishing books and contribute to literary journals weeklies and even newspapers 4 4 Hostile Media Perception thesis One of the recurrent questions related to the blogosphere in general and to bloggers in particular is to assess the motivations that bring citizens to blog BBC 2005a BBC 2005b AHRENS 2006 From among the reasons to blog I want to underline what other academics has named Hostile Media Perception HMP HWANG THORSON BORAH CLELANDPERLMUTTER 2007 Many bloggers write because they feel alienated from mainstream media since they do not express their point of views and in not few cases these media be there press radio or television defend the exact opposite view about a topic a policy a candidate etc HMP has been considered one of the most important motivations to blog It explains to a certain degree why an individual with moderate to strong political or social thoughts a more or less solid education and digital background and access to the net become a 11 blogger Of course is not the only reason but is an important one KAYE 2007 In the case of the Catosfera it is worth to study if the HMP thesis deserves credit This is an ongoing research that I think will produce some outcome in the months to come SORT 2008 Preliminary explorations such as the one I did during the above mentioned Jornades de la Catosfera last January tend to reinforce the thesis that a very important number of Catalan bloggers feel alienated from the domestic mediasphere that is the catalan communication system understood as a set formed by traditional media press radio and television where the most powerful have a certain leverage against the rest Again the perception is not only of alienation but reaches in some cases the total opposition since they view mainstream media not only as adversaries but even enemies 3 5 The Catosfera politics as usual This paper cannot be finished without addressing one of the from my point of view Catosfera most negative elements I call it the colonization by political parties members Let s take a look One thing is blogitics that is the set of blogs that have as a primary subject the political process political system political ideas campaigns and so on YOUSEFZADEH 2004 But another very different thing is the inflation or overrepresentation inside the Catosfera of blogs from party members that they open only to repeat as parrots the arguments and point of views elaborated by party s propaganda and communication units As a consequence there is a large number of blogs with zero interest but because they follow a party guideline are included in political blogs directories Many of these bloggers post few entries and in case they opt to link to other blogs usually these other blogs are those authored by relevant members of the same party As a consequence free bloggers that is bloggers not submitted to a party discipline are sidelined or ignored by those directories The result is that they reach a lower visibility In a certain way this colonization of organic blogs is copying to the virtual sphere to the Catalan online political system CLOS SORT 2007 the partitocracy that exists in the Catalan off line political system Then is it rational to build a virtual public sphere with the same negative elements that exist in the real public sphere From my point of 12 view the rationale of blogs is to have a more authentic political life One that rejects doublespeak that is language constructed to disguise or distort its actual meaning often resulting in a communication bypass Doublespeak may take the form of bald euphemisms e g downsizing for layoffs or deliberate ambiguity Doublespeak is a disparaging label for any euphemistic term perceived to be uttered in bad faith 4 Conclusions This paper do not present a finished research but only a milestone in an ongoing one Catosfera influence in Catalan politics and mediasphere is growing Undoubtely its impact is limited to certain sociodemographic and education groups with a high level of homegenity Catalan language has not been recognised as an official european language by the European Union even though has a higher number of speakers than others european languages declared official In spite of that it deserves to be underlined that it has been able to generate a powerful always in relative terms community of bloggers Lately on political parties granted access to bloggers to meetings assemblies events be they public or organic in more or less the same status as journalists Also candidates leaders or communications directors contact with Catosfera members and invited them to dialogue exchange points of view send videoquestions to get closer and closer On the other hand Catosfera is hiperpolitised Catalan bloggers in a large number focus on politics debates and activism At the same time the off line politics shows a general drop in electoral and referenda participation Can we explain this as a consequence of young and digital socialized generation distrust towards traditional politics Towards Catalan well established partitocracy Also in this paper it is suggested that one of the main motivations for blogging is Hostile Media Perception thesis That implies that among bloggers there is an important degree or a straightforward opposition to the ideological and political views of Catalan mainstream media Although this assumption deserves a deeper research to confirm it this paper assumes that a number of catalan citizens with a moderate to strong political and social activism with a basic digital and educationa knowledge or 13 background and access to the net will continue to channel the expression of their ideas and acting through blogs and others digital tools relied to alternative activism COYER DOWMUNT

provisional that the disengagement from mainstream media among Catalan bloggers is quantitatively high and qualitatively strong In order to reach a more scientifically based conclusion I have prepared a 25 questions survey that will be addressed in principle to the assistants to the Jornades and in which the MHP will be a key element 4 http en wikipedia org wiki Doublespeak last accessed 15 04 2008
