please do not quote without permission 1 Learning the ropes 2 Abstract The strong orientation towards candidates in the Finnish election system encouraging decentralized candidate driven campaigns offers a platform for experimentation in Web campaigning In the 2007 Finnish parliamentary elections an advancement in campaigning by candidates was the adoption of various Web 2 0 applications Primarily candidates integrated blogs in their online campaigns For candidates blogs offered a new way to reach out to voters and convey a more personal image of themselves Moreover the adoption of blogs by candidates potentially increased the interactive opportunities for voters to communicate with candidates This paper aims at empirically exploring the adoption of blogs amongst candidates in the 2007 elections First the distribution of candidates having blogs was examined according to candidate related variables identified in earlier research on the adoption of Web campaigning A total of 34 of the 1 997 candidates had blogs These early adopters were disproportionately young female running in highly urbanized constituencies and representing major or minor parties rather than fringe parties Second candidates blogging practices were analyzed Only 56 of the blogs allowed for public comments Candidates running as incumbents and representing major parties were particularly reluctant to provide this interactive feature The candidates allowing for comments were more likely young challengers running in urban constituencies and representing smaller parties The interactive blogs did however generally receive extremely few comments Mdn 2 Finally a content analysis of 100 randomly sampled blogs shows that candidates of all types generally preferred campaign and issue frames over personal frames mostly linked to their own Web sites and seldom took an offensive stance Learning the ropes 3 Introduction In a way the name of one of the numerous blogs or weblogs that were run by political candidates in the 2007 Finnish parliamentary elections The Compulsory Blog summarizes the general approach to the adoption of this novel online campaigning tool Compared to the previous parliamentary elections held in 2003 where only a handful of candidates provided online diaries a large share of the candidates this time integrated blogs into their campaigns 34 of the of 1 997 candidates had their own blog Strandberg Carlson 2007 For the candidates blogs offered a new way to reach out to voters and convey a more personal image of themselves Moreover the adoption of blogs by candidates potentially increased the interactive opportunities for voters to communicate directly with candidates since blogs can allow comments from users Still the expectations regarding the positive effects of operating blogs were arguably not that high among the candidates As the candidates were probably relatively uncertain about the efficiency of the new campaigning tool many of them might had decided to operate a blog a compulsory blog since they feared consequences of not having this latest campaigning device There are several additional reasons for this rapid rise in popularity of blogs as a Web campaigning tool among Finnish parliamentary candidates Conceivably international campaigning trends may have spurred an interest in blogging among the candidates In the wake of the 2004 U S presidential primaries and presidential election where campaign blogging by candidates made its breakthrough e g Kerbel Bloom 2006 Trammell 2006 Trammell et al 2006 blogging was during 2005 adopted by political parties and candidates in parliamentary elections in several European countries Abold Heltsche 2006 Albrecht Lübcke HartigPerschke 2007 Jackson 2006 Klastrup Pedersen 2007 Stanyer 2006 In Finland campaign Learning the ropes 4 blogging had made a quantum leap in the 2006 presidential elections where the personal blogs of the major candidates received significant news coverage and created public awareness of and interest in electoral blogging Carlson 2007 The election system adds yet another reason to the adoption of blogs by Finnish parliamentary candidates Contrary to most other Western European countries the electoral system in Finland is strongly oriented towards individual candidates Using proportional representation in multimember districts the Finns cannot cast ballots according to party lists of candidates but merely for unranked individual candidates representing parties or electoral alliances This system predominantly brings about candidate driven campaigns Thus Finnish candidates invest in personal campaigns and usually have their own support groups organizing campaign activities raising money and generating publicity Ruostetsaari Mattila 2002 In general these groups operate relatively independently from the parties the party organization functions as a background resource and coordinator Sundberg 1995 As suggested by Greer and LaPointe 2003 p 116 candidate centred systems allowing for decentralized models of campaigning offer a more flexible and diverse platform for candidates to innovate in how to reach and engage voters on the Web Indeed Finnish political candidates have from early on experimented with individual uses of the Web in elections Carlson Strandberg in press 1 Against this background the adoption of campaign blogs by candidates in the 2007 Finnish general election is not surprising However the extent of blog usage among the candidates 34 operating a blog is remarkable In comparison few candidates blogged in the 2005 parliamentary elections in Denmark and the UK 5 5 and 2 respectively Klastrup Pedersen 2007 Ward 2005 In fact the Finnish parliamentary candidates used blogs at a similar rate as the Senatorial candidates in the 2006 midterm elections in the U S with its Learning the ropes 5 pronounced candidate centred system Among the 129 Senate candidates 39 featured a blog on their Web sites Gulati Williams 2007 The large amount of blogging candidates in the Finnish 2007 elections N 669 makes it feasible to empirically examine some areas of enquiry that have general significance beyond the specific Finnish case and that hitherto has not been widely attended to in previous research focusing on blog usage by campaigns On a general level the areas of enquiry that will be empirically explored in this paper deal with the initial adoption and utilization of new campaigning tools in this case blogs by political candidates Three main areas of enquiry will be examined The first area concerns patterns of adoption and focuses on the early adopters of the new online campaigning device what kinds of candidates were more likely to make use of campaign blogs The second research area is about the adoption of blog practices among the blogging candidates what kind of blogging activities did they engage in To what extent did different kinds of candidates engage in different kinds of practices Particularly attention is paid to the comment feature of blogs allowing feedback opportunities to blog readers and giving politicians an opportunity to maintain public dialogues with the readers The final area of enquiry deals with the content of the blogs i e the topics that the candidates blogged on Framework This part of the paper is yet to be written I will here define camping blogs elaborate on the three areas of enquiry and finally motivate the independent variables i e candidate related factors gender age size of the candidates party incumbency status and urbanization level of the candidates constituency The 2007 Finnish National Elections Learning the ropes 6 Before turning to the empirical analysis the context of the 2007 Finnish parliamentary elections is briefly sketched see further Arter 2007 Nurmi Nurmi 2007 Statistics Finland 2007 In the elections held on 18 March 200 MPs were elected to the unicameral legislature from 14 multi member constituencies and one single member district the Åland Islands The proportional election system with open party lists requests Finns to vote for a candidate and not a party The total number of candidates in the elections was 2 004 In total 18 parties nominated candidates approximately two thirds of the candidates were fielded by current parliamentary parties Women s proportion of candidates was 39 9 Of all candidates 69 were aged 40 or over In total 169 incumbent candidates were running for re election Besides campaigning traditionally offline a large share of the candidates more than 60 launched their own Web sites Strandberg Carlson 2007 The voter turnout was 67 9 the lowest since the 1939 elections Eight parties gained seats in the new parliament The support for the three major parties was quite even capturing together approximately 65 of the vote Among the smaller parties the Green League and the populist True Finns were successful in these elections Data and Methods The candidates overall adoption rate of blogs was assessed within a broader project examining Web campaigning efforts in the 2007 elections see Carlson Strandberg 2007 Strandberg Carlson 2007 All candidates running in the 14 multi member constituencies N 1 997 were surveyed concerning their online presence i e whether they had their own campaign Web sites and blogs A candidate was considered to have a blog if a he or she had a Web site or page explicitly characterized as a blog or online diary My Diary Candidate X s Weblog etc b the entries the blog posts on that Web site or page were displayed in reverse chronological order Thus in conformity with several other studies of blogging by Learning the ropes 7 political candidates a relatively broad definition of a blog was chosen cf Bichard 2006 Klastrup Pedersen 2007 Trammell et al 2006 Contrary to a study by Albrecht et al 2007 p 509 observing blogs in the 2005 German parliamentary elections the definition chosen here does not require that blogs allow for reader comments or link to other blogs As an aim of this paper is to assess how candidates adopt blogging practices it was considered valuable not to exclude blogs lacking comment features and links The candidates individual blogs could either be integrated in their campaign Web sites or located on other sites e g party Web sites or blog publishing sites such as blogger com In order to track candidates Web sites and blogs several official sources were used during the two final weeks of the election campaign candidate listings published on the parties Web sites the election Web site of the Finnish public broadcasting company Yleisradio providing information on the candidates Web presence additional Google searches for name and surname of candidates Of course the tracked candidate Web sites were consulted too Table 1 presenting the results of the numerical survey shows that most candidates that blogged also had a campaign Web site INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE To analyze what kinds of candidates that were more likely to adopt campaign blogs candidate specific characteristics discussed above in the framework gender age size of the candidates party2 incumbency and the urbanization level of the candidates constituencies were using mainly the same sources mentioned above established for all 1 997 candidates Bivariate analysis as well as multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify those factors that are strongly associated with having a blog In examining the adoption of blogging practices the tracked blogs N 669 were initially coded for presence or absence of a comment function In order to address the question Learning the ropes 8 concerning which candidates that were more likely to allow comments on their blogs bivariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were again applied by considering the above mentioned candidate related characteristics as independent variables In order to examine to what extent blogs allowing for comments did receive public response a comment rate was calculated relating the number of comments to the number of blog posts average comments per posting In exploring the extent of reader comments 100 blogs approximately 15 were randomly sampled from the total 699 observed blogs Of these sampled blogs 56 online diaries allowed for comments In these blogs the frequency of blog posts and comments was observed during the hot phase of the election campaign i e four weeks prior to Election Day The adoption of other blogging practices than allowing for comments was explored using the same 100 randomly sampled blogs and the same four week period When assessing the blogging candidates activity the number of blog posts and the number of words per post was recorded In all 790 blog posts were observed In observing linking practices the number of hyperlinks per post was firstly recorded Secondly an internal to external hyperlink ratio was established cf Williams et al 2005 making it possible to assess to what extent candidates preferred to link to Web pages within their blog or Web site In order to establish this ratio the recorded links were categorized as either pointing to internal Web pages or external Web pages Differences between different kinds of candidates as to blogging activity and linking practices was examined using at this stage bivariate analysis and again considering the above mentioned candidate related characteristics as independent variables Regarding finally the content of the candidates blogs the 790 blog posts of the 100 randomly sampled blogs were firstly coded as predominantly using an issue frame focusing on political issues and issue positions a campaign frame focusing on the campaign and Learning the ropes 9 campaigning matters or a personal frame focusing on personal matters related to the candidates cf Bichard 2006 Druckman 2005 In order to compare the candidates use of different blog post frames the percentage of posts having a certain frame of all posts produced by a candidate during the examined period was calculated Secondly each post was coded for the presence or absence of offensive or negative messages criticizing opponent candidates parties party leaders or cabinet ministers Again aiming at comparing subgroups of candidates the analysis unit was here the percentage of all blog posts produced by a candidate that contained an offensive message Findings Patters of Blog Adoption by Candidates To begin with what characterized the early adopters of blog campaigning among the Finnish parliamentary candidates Table 2 compares the distribution of candidates operating a blog according to the candidate related variables selected earlier INSERT TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE Most importantly Table 2 shows that there is a considerable gap in blog adoption between one the one hand candidates representing major or minor parties and on the other hand fringe party candidates It should be stressed that minor party candidates adopted blogs to a similar extent as candidates fielded by the major parties In fact the party with the highest rate of blogging candidates was a minor party the Green League with 61 of its candidates having a blog see Appendix A There is also a considerable generational gap in blog adoption As could be expected younger candidates blogged to a larger extent than older candidates 50 years and older Interestingly a higher proportion of the female candidates blogged compared to the male candidates Furthermore incumbents having more resources and being competitive runners Learning the ropes 10 adopted blogs to a higher rate than challengers Finally regarding blog adoption among candidates according to constituency urbanization only modest differences are found Before interpreting these findings a logistic regression model distinguishing the relative importance and independent effect of the candidate related factors on blog adoption is presented in Table 3 INSERT TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE By and large the regression model confirms the findings of Table 2 Evidently party size is the main decisive factor of blog adoption the odds of using blogs are 969 higher for major party candidates and 726 higher for minor party candidates than they are for candidates running for fringe parties 3 There are three possible explanations to this First fringe party organizations have fewer resources to assist their candidates in planning and creating individual Web campaigns Second the Finnish election system makes it hard for fringe party candidates to gain seats in the parliament thus hampering their propensity to campaign seriously Third these candidates may have given priority to offline campaigning seeing that the target voter groups of the fringe parties are arguably not among the most web savvy citizens The regression analysis furthermore confirms considerable generational gaps the odds of operating a blog are 210 higher for the youngest candidates ages 18 34 and 76 higher for the middle aged candidates 35 49 than they are for older candidates 50 years and over This is hardly surprising seeing that the younger generations show greater familiarity with and interest in the Internet The model does not however verify an independent effect of running as an incumbent The explanation for this is that incumbents with blogs ran solely for major or minor parties Finally when controlling for other factors gender and urbanization level of the constituency still have an effect on blog adoption Thus female candidates are 33 more likely to blog than male candidates As female candidates were not more likely to have a Web site than Learning the ropes 11 their male counterparts in the same 2007 elections Strandberg Carlson 2007 this finding suggests that women running as candidates viewed the blog as an appealing Web campaigning device Candidates nominated in the most urbanized constituencies are 41 more likely to have a blog than candidates fielded in constituencies with a low urbanization level 79 Tentatively candidates running in highly urbanized constituencies deem that their voters have a large enough interest in the Web and are online to a high enough degree making it worth to set up a personal blog Hitherto the adoption of blogs by subgroups of candidates has been examined among all fielded candidates many of them 30 1 lacking Web sites as well as blogs Delimiting the analysis to the online candidates those having a Web site N 1 342 makes it possible to explore an additional question about blog adoption by candidates which candidates having a Web site are more likely to additionally integrate a blog in their online campaigns Could it for example be that once fringe party candidates establish a Web presence they do not lag behind other candidates regarding blog adoption The bivariate analysis presented in Table 4 explores these questions INSERT TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE The findings in Table 4 do not change the picture of blog adoption by candidates presented earlier Large gaps regarding party size and generations remain statistically significant in explaining blog adoption among the candidates having Web sites In addition online female candidates are somewhat keener to maintain a blog than their male counterparts Incumbent and challenger candidates blog to a similar rate Finally candidates running in highly urbanized constituencies blog to a larger extent than contenders in constituencies with lower urbanization Learning the ropes 12 levels Again a logistic regression model distinguishing the relative importance and independent effect of these factors confirms the results of the bivariate analysis Table 5 INSERT TABLE 5 ABOUT HERE When controlling for other factors the odds of operating blogs among Web candidates are 279 higher for major party candidates and 334 higher for minor party candidates than they are for fringe party candidates It should be noted that running for a minor party is even a stronger factor of blog adoption than running for a major party Age is the third strongest predictor The odds of writing a blog are 179 higher for young candidates ages 18 34 and 65 higher for the middle aged contenders 35 49 than they are for the oldest generation of candidates Moreover the odds to maintain a blog are 49 higher for the most urban candidates than they are for candidates fielded in the constituency group with the lowest urbanization level Finally although the odds ratio do not fully reach the statistical significance level of 0 05 female candidates are 23 likelier than their male counterparts to integrate a blog in their online campaigns p 0 07 In sum irrespective of whether blog adoption by candidates is examined among all fielded candidates or solely among the candidates having a Web presence a similar pattern is revealed The early adopters of campaign blogging were disproportionately representing minor or major parties rather than fringe parties young female and running in highly urbanized constituencies Do the same factors particularly influence the blogging candidates adoption of blogging practices This topic is explored next Adoption of Blogging Practices Allowing for Comments Learning the ropes 13 A majority of the 669 blogging candidates 56 2 allowed for comments on the blogs However when examining the distribution of candidates permitting comments according to candidate related variables some marked differences appear Table 6 INSERT TABLE 6 ABOUT HERE The most striking result in Table 6 is that the candidates representing major parties were reluctant to open up their blogs for comments compared to the minor and fringe party candidates Strikingly a similarly large share of the minor and fringe party candidates approximately 73 allowed for blog comments Again an additional examination of individual parties not reported in detail here shows that The Green League stands out as a case apart 92 of their 123 blogging candidates permitted comment responses The reluctance to allow reader feedback also applies to incumbent candidates when compared with challenger candidates This is not surprising since the majority of the incumbent candidates 77 represent major parties Table 6 points to a generational gap too The young candidates aged 18 34 particularly offered feedback opportunities to their readers The same goes for candidates running in highly urbanized constituencies Interestingly blogging female and male candidates allowed for comments to a similar degree Once again a logistic regression model examining the relative importance and independent effect of the variables confirms these findings Table 7 Thus in sum the candidates allowing for comments were disproportionately running for minor or fringe parties challengers young and running in highly urbanized constituencies INSERT TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE The interactive candidate blogs did however generally receive very few comments An analysis of the 58 candidate blogs that allowed for comments in the random sample reveals that 43 of the blogs did not receive a single comment during the examined four week period What Learning the ropes 14 is more 85 of the blogs received less than ten comments The median value of the number of comments is thus low 2 0 i e half of the interactive blogs received less than two comments 4 An additional survey of the few sampled blogs that were interactive and that had received comments n 33 shows that candidates did engage in dialogue or discussion by replying to comments in 18 of these blogs 55 Thus generalizing from the 100 randomly sampled blogs this finding suggests that two way communication between the blogging candidate and the blog readers took place in only 18 of the blogs operated by candidates in the 2007 elections Subsequently did certain types of candidates receive more feedback than other kinds of candidates As merely 58 of the 100 sampled blogs allowed for comments the comparison of subgroups of candidates with interactive blogs within the random sample of candidate blogs resulted in rather low numbers of cases Therefore Kruskal Wallis non parametric analysis of variance ANOVA was utilized in addressing this question Remarkably using four candidaterelated independent variables gender age size of the candidates party and the urbanization level of the candidates constituency categorized as above5 the bivariate analyses failed to show any statistically significant differences in the number of received blog comments between the compared subgroups of candidates However as rather few candidate blogs were included in this analysis and the groups compared therefore were small this finding must be treated with caution Adoption of Blogging Practices Activity and Linking In this section two other blogging practices distinguished in the framework are examined blogging activity and linking practices Regarding the activity of the blogging candidates it should initially be noted that almost all blog posts were written by the candidates themselves or at least their posts were written in order to give that impression Merely 17 of the Learning the ropes 15 790 examined blog posts 2 were written by other persons that the candidates The analysis of the sampled blogs6 suggests that the candidates did not generally blog frequently Although the number of posts written in the blogs during the examined four week period ranged from a low of 11 to a high of 72 the median number of posts was low 6 interquartile range 8 Thus during the examined period half of the blogs were updated with less than 6 posts Moreover in 70 of the blogs the candidates had posted less than 10 entries in this phase of the campaign Comparing the mean number of blog posts for subgroups of candidates male and female candidates challenger and incumbents major and minor fringe party candidates the three age cohorts and the three groups of candidates running in constituencies with different urbanization levels using parametric as well as nonparametric ANOVA no statistically significant differences were found Regarding linking practices subsequently it should initially be noted that the sampled blogging candidates generally used hyperlinks pointing to various Web pages On average the candidates added 2 55 links per posting S D 1 98 Mdn 2 43 Comparing subgroups one statistically significant difference was found on average minor fringe party candidates provided more links per posting M 3 20 n 50 than major party candidates M 1 80 n 41 p 001 ANOVA Turning to the more interesting question concerning the internal to external hyperlink ratio the analysis clearly reveals that the candidates preferred to link to Web pages within their own blog or Web site In the sampled blogs there were a total of 393 hyperlinks in the blog posts written during the examined four week period Merely 30 of these links 7 6 went to external Web pages Turning to the candidate level the mean internal to external link ratio for the candidates was 89 S D 22 Mdn 100 Comparing subgroups using KruskalWallis nonparametric ANOVA since the data were skewed from the normal distribution one Learning the ropes 16 statistically significant although not dramatical difference was revealed 7 The internal to external link ratio was generally lower for the young candidates aged 18 34 M 84 Mdn 94 n 28 than for the oldest group of candidates aged 50 and over M 98 Mdn 100 n 23 p 05 Topical Frames and Offensive Messages in the Candidate Blogs Finally what did the candidates generally blog about and to what extent did the candidates publish offensive blog posts Regarding the blog topics it should initially be repeated that the unit of analysis in the content analysis is not the blog post the focus is on the blogging candidates Therefore for each candidate the percentage of blog posts having a certain frame during the examined period was calculated Examining firstly the sampled candidates with blogs n 91 see endnote 6 the following results were given Most frequently the blogging candidates used frames predominantly focusing on campaign matters when writing the blog posts In the blogs the average share of campaign framed posts was 48 S D 31 Still the candidates used issue frames almost as often the average share of posts having an issue frame was 40 S D 32 Notably framing the blog posts focusing predominately on personal matters was generally not a common strategy among the candidates the average share of campaign framed posts in the blogs was 12 S D 19 Whereas the share of issue and campaign frames was normally distributed Kolmogorov Smirnov test the distribution of the share of personal frames was skewed p 001 Therefore it should be noted that the median and the interquartile range of the share of posts having a personal frame was 0 and 17 respectively These figures further confirm that candidates in general did not emphasize personal matters in their blogs Did different types of candidates focus on different topics then Did for Learning the ropes 17 example female candidates use personal frames more frequently than male candidates These questions are addressed in Table 8 INSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE Interestingly the findings presented in Table 8 suggest that the blogging candidates regardless of age gender incumbency status size of their party and the type of constituency that they ran in framed their blog posts in a very similar way The statistical tests did not even detect differences that could be considered as statistical trends p 10 Thus the candidates all framed their blog messages in a quite uniform manner Concerning the use of negative campaign blog strategies then it should first be noted that the randomly sampled candidates n 91 were not particularly offensive in their blogs In the blogs the share of posts containing offensive messages was on average 19 S D 24 Again as the variable is not normally distributed Kolmogorov Smirnov test p 001 the median value 8 0 may be more accurate Thus in half of the candidates blogs the share of offensive blog posts was on average less than 8 Then again there was considerable variation between the candidate blogs as to the share of negative posts from a low of 0 to a high of 100 interquartile range 33 Were there accordingly certain types of candidates that were more offensive than other Comparing the subgroups using Kruskal Wallis nonparametric ANOVA two statistically significant differences were found First male candidates were generally more offensive Mdn 22 5 n 40 than female candidates Mdn 4 2 n 51 p 05 Second minor fringe party candidates took an offensive stance to a higher extent Mdn 17 4 n 50 than major party candidates Mdn 0 0 n 41 p 05 Summary and conclusions Learning the ropes 18 This section is yet to be written too The conclusions are of course partly dependent on the framework that is incomplete at the moment Nevertheless I will in my paper presentation summarize the findings and additionally present some preliminary conclusions Learning the ropes 19 References Abold R Heltsche M

and the other Nordic countries Norris 2000 2 A categorization by Norris 2003 p 28 is used here major parties are those with more than 20 cent of all seats in the national parliament minor parties are those with more than 3 but less than 20 of the seats fringe parties are those that lack at least 3 of the elected members of the parliament 3 The percentage change in odds was calculated using the formula 100 Exp B 1 4 Minimum 0 maximum 41 interquartile range 5 Relating the number of comments to the number of blog posts in the 56 blogs does not change the picture of a very low reader interest in talking back to the candidates The median value of the average comments per posting is 0 3 interquartile range 0 8 5 The incumbency status of the candidates could not be used as a variable here since there were only two blogs run by incumbent candidates in this reduced subsample Moreover as there were few blogs operated by fringe parties in this subsample the party size variable was dichotomized major party candidates versus minor or fringe candidates 6 It should be noted that 9 of the 100 sampled blogs were not possible to use in this analysis thus reducing the random sample to 91 blogs Three of these nine blogs did not contain any posts while six blogs were malfunctioning at the time of analyzing blogging practices as well as content matters 7 A total of 77 candidates were included in this analysis since some candidates did not use hyperlinks at all in their blogs Learning the ropes 23 Tables Table 1 The Distribution of Candidates with Web Sites and Blogs Candidates
