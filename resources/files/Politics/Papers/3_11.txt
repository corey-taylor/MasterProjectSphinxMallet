handled the appearance of Web 2 0 focusing on the campaign for the local elections in September 2007 During 2007 Facebook became the most popular website in Norway with YouTube rising to number three The political parties appeared bewildered by the phenomenon indicating a similar stage at which they were some years earlier with Web 1 0 But as local elections were coming up in September 2007 most parties felt they had to do something This paper analyses all seven parliamentary parties and four smaller parties outside parliament during the long campaign focusing on Facebook YouTube and blogging Central topics in the discussion 1 Explaining variations in party strategies towards Web 2 0 2 Whether the use of Web 2 0 might a Enhance participatory democracy by lowering the threshold for involvement of party grassroots and sympathisers b Enhance the competitive aspects of democracy by increasing the visibility of parties that attract little attention from the mass media and lack the resources to advertise The data show that all parties were uncertain of the political potential of Web 2 0 but also great variations in their determination and ability to formulate and implement a strategy Parties representing socialist or post materialist values were the most positive Factors like party size material resources or lack of media attention did not appear to be systematically related with Web 2 0 strategy Consequently the effects related to enhancing participatory or competitive forms of democracy are also highly ambiguous The fact that party politics on Web 2 0 still is a marginal activity and at an experimental stage add to this ambiguity 1 1 Introduction The political impact of Information and Communication Technology ICT has fascinated researchers for a long time The introduction of the graphical web interface in the mid 1990s through browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape triggered the break through of the Internet as a channel for political communication During the subsequent years most political parties of the established democracies have established their presence on the internet the party web site being a common standard Margetts 2001 introduced the concept of cyber parties to describe the ICT based party of the future However at the present time politics are still mainly conducted through more traditional places than cyberspace As remarked by Tim Berners Lee the World Wide Web was intended as a platform for exchange of information and multilateral communication from the start Amaya the web browser developed by the W3 Consortium provided an interface for viewing and editing hyperlinked documents accessible on the web Furthermore newsgroups mailing lists chat rooms bulletin boards existed even before the WWW Hence the technological preconditions for multilateral communication networking and user generated contents in general existed right from the start The Internet and the WWW therefore seemed the ideal forum to revitalize a liberal democracy which for several years had been diagnosed as decaying through professionalization lack of participation and even cartelization in the party system The most ambitious cyber democrats with participative or discursive leaning predicted that the internet would lead to increased grassroots involvement in campaigning public discussion and formulation of policies A less ambitious but still optimistic version of cyber democracy would expect the internet to generate a more pluralist or competitive form of democracy As public access to the internet broadened it would become a cheap and effective platform to market meaningful political alternatives for voters A decade later interest and involvement in politics is lower than ever even in the former East Bloc according to the latest European Social Survey 200x Half of the Norwegian respondents agreed to the statement I have little or no interest in politics During the same period Norwegian party politics on the web have been firmly established Most of the political parties have their own website and most of the voters have daily access to the web The web sites are professionalized in management and appearance increasingly turning away from using the opportunities for participation inherent in the new interactive technologies Interparty variation appears mainly in the degree of professionalization which can be accounted for by variations in available resources thus limiting the pluralizing effects on the party system There is little room for interactivity and participation visits to party web sites remain at a low level and variation in hits seem to correlate with party size In brief neither the predictions of the participatory version nor the pluralist version of cyber democracy are corroborated by the development However there was a parallel line of development on the web which took many party strategists by surprise For lack of better words this line of development has been categorized under the heading Web 2 0 in contrast to the old Web 1 0 As observed by Berners Lee the technology has been there all the way but Web 2 0 2 still may be useful shorthand for the recent and rapid growth in the implementation of the technology During 2007 Facebook became the most popular website in Norway with YouTube rising to number three The political parties appeared bewildered by the phenomenon indicating a similar stage at which they were some years earlier with Web 1 0 But as local elections were coming up in September 2007 most parties felt they had to do something In short they were forced to alpha test an unfamiliar technology outside the safe surroundings of a sandbox This paper analyses all seven parliamentary parties and four smaller parties outside parliament during the long campaign focusing on Facebook YouTube and blogging Central topics in the discussion is the 1 variations in party strategies towards Web 2 0 and 2 whether Web 2 0 might a enhance participatory democracy by lowering the threshold for involvement of party grassroots and sympathisers and b enhance the competitive aspects of democracy by increasing the visibility of parties that attract little attention from the mass media and lack the resources to advertise In short would the 2 0 version of the web succeed where the 1 0 version apparently failed in revitalizing democracy 2 The political and party system Units and context Norway is a parliamentary democracy with general elections held every fourth year The electoral system is based on the principle of proportional representation PR As a consequence of PR and the persistence of a relatively strong centre periphery cleavage the party system is close to what Sartori 1990 calls moderate pluralism multiple parties but little presence of centrifugal forces The level of political participation and interest has been relatively high although in a downward trend as in many established democracies Recent general elections of 1997 2001 and 2005 have been contested by about 20 parties But only seven parties have been consistent in winning seats in parliament Local elections for assemblies at municipal and county level are held mid term between general elections most recently in 2007 Besides the national parties these elections are contested by a number of ad hoc or permanent local lists representing particular local conflicts 3 Table 1 Votes in the municipal elections 2007 Party and ideological position Left Red Electoral Alliance Socialist Left Party Environmental Party Greens Labour Party

variations in voting patterns stemming from local structural factors This study samples the Web 2 0 presence of all seven major national parties which gained more than 5 of the national vote and are represented in the national parliament Four of the five largest of the minor national parties none of which have seats in the national parliament are added to the study1 1 The Environmental Party The Greens was not included in the study In addition to the national party organization the local party organizations in the municipality of Lillehammer were sampled Lillehammer is a small town municipality of about 25 000 inhabitants located in the inner Eastern region of Norway Quite typically for local elections a local list of candidates representing local issues took part in the election and got 5 1 of the votes while many of the minor national parties were not able to put forward local candidates Unfortunately local data for Lillehammer are not yet incorporated into the analysis as presented in this paper 4 3 Web 2 0 and gathering of data Web 2 0 is a much abused term Nielsen 2007 Tim Berners Lee does for instance not see any revolution and says Web 2 0 is a piece of jargon nobody even knows what it means Cited in Anderson 2006 Berners Lee goes on to pinpoint the evolutionary aspect of it as it all builds on existing techniques The evolutionary aspects are contained within Tim O Reilly s original definition of the Web 2 0 as a set of economic social and technological trends that collectively forms the basis for the next generation of the Internet a more mature distinctive medium characterized by user participation openness and network effects O Reilly 2007 For our purposes Web 2 0 refers to new web based services specifically designed for 1 open collaborative publishing and or or 2 to form and participate in social networks on the internet through the interface offered by the WWW Social network sites is defined by boyd and Ellison 2007 as web based services that allow individuals to 1 construct a public or semi public profile within a bounded system 2 articulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection and 3 view and traverse their list of connections and those made by others within the system The recent popularity of Web 2 0 is indicated by the prominent position of this type of sites in the top 25 of web sites

Retrieved October 29th 2007 As the data reported in the table are collected through Alexa they represent just a sample of Norwegian web users and only report those sites with a common URL as entrance to personal pages on top However they indicate the rise in popularity of Web 2 0 and the national peculiarities in the adoption of Web 2 02 Facebook s relative popularity in Norway is practically unrivalled on a global scale while MySpace has never become as popular in Norway as in the USA 2 Some nations may more or less invade some sites possibly Brazilian users invasion of Google s Orkut http orkut com being the most prominent here 5 This study focuses on the activities of the political parties as organizations on Web 2 0 not the activities of individual politicians or political discussion in general Therefore links from the official party web sites provided a first overview of relevant Web 2 0 sites indicating what was officially approved by the party in question The next step was a scan of the Web 2 0 sites in the Alexa Norwegian top 100 for party names in abbreviated and full form Facebook and YouTube stood out immediately as the most relevant sites to study Party activity on the other sites was either marginal or totally absent3 In addition to Facebook and YouTube the study includes a survey of the ambitious attempts of the leading Norwegian newspaper VG to establish common forums for blogging at VG blog http www vgb no and posting of videos from the parties at snutter no http www snutter no Although neither appeared in the top 100 they are of particular interest as the conscious initiative of the media to establish common forums Samples of the parties pages on Facebook YouTube and VG blog were taken at regular intervals before and after the election on September 10th 2007 using the Scrapbook plug in of Firefox4 for cataloguing and annotation Further data was provided by 11 semi structured interviews with key party personnel on the party s web strategy and presence These were conducted during the period immediately before and after the elections5 The sample of Web 2 0 sites mentioned above appeared as representative from what the party informants stated in the interviews although none of them pretended to have a full overview For instance only the youth organization of one of the parties appeared to have established themselves on MySpace http www myspace com fremskrittspartietsungdom 4 See plugin hompeage at http amb vis ne jp mozilla scrapbook 5 These interviews were conducted face to face or via telephone between mid July 2007 and mid October 2007 They lasted about one hour using an interview guide with a battery of questions Besides several questions on the web in general there was a direct question in the questionnaire guide asking To what degree is the party aware of and has started to use what is known as Web 2 0 blog wikis YouTube MySpace etc The guide was sent to the interview subjects in advance and transcripts of the interviews were sent afterwards for comments and corrections 3 6 4 E readiness among voters and parties E readiness in terms of daily internet use in the Norwegian population is high although a significant intergenerational digital divide persists between those that have reached retirement age and the rest Furthermore assuming that the persons with access in 2000 have continued to use the internet they would by 2007 have gathered considerable experience and competence as users Table x Internet use in Norway 2000 2007 All 27 66 Used internet on a daily basis Age

users spent considerable time on sites associated with Web 2 0 technologies In advance new political trends from the 1980s onwards had made the parties more dependent on campaigning and communicating with voters through the media Political dealignment Dalton 1988 appeared in the established democracies several years before the advent of the World Wide Web illustrated by the voters tendency to shift party from election to election The share of Norwegian voters who decided who to vote for during the campaign increased from around one fifth 21 in 1985 to almost half of the voters 47 in 2001 Aardal 2003a 13ff Hence substantial parts of the electorate are now influenced by short term campaign activity communicated through the media rather than long term partisanship But the press are no longer closely affiliated with specific political parties or distinct ideologies and for TV and radio principles of commercial or public broadcasting assured there never were such affiliations in the first place Aardal et al 17ff Allern 2001 125ff BjÃ¸rklund 1991 Presented with a new and relatively cheap technology for communicating directly with the voters the choice appeared to be relatively simple for party strategists The process of establishment of party politics on the web was to take several years6 But according to the interviewed informants the internet had a high priority Norwegian party web sites started to appear well before the general election of 1997 interviews Way Back Machine By the 2001 election 20 out of 22 registered parties had established their own website although they had not developed any web strategy and there still was scepticism within the party organisations Hestvik 2004 235ff Things had improved by the next national election in 2005 and at least some of the parties developed 6 7 in all parties by the 2007 campaign and the major parties allocated considerable resources to their presence on the web 5 From a mature Web 1 0 to Web 2 0 hype While the quality and size of web sites in the 2005 campaign varied among the parliamentary parties the major digital divide appeared to be whether the party was represented in parliament or not But by 2007 even the small parties seemed to be able to present themselves far more professionally on the web than their bigger competitors were only a few years earlier Party websites may therefore be diagnosed as becoming more mature But this form of maturity appeared to be oriented towards professionalized unilateral delivery rather than encouraging the interactivity inherent in the ideals participatory democracy Many parties had previously held such ambitions and established open discussion forums on their websites during the first phase These forums were mostly closed down as early as before the 2001 election due to low activity harassments and lack of sufficient time to survey or participate Hestvik 2004 Saglie 2006 Reviews of the web sites in 2005 and 2007 revealed that the variations had become sufficiently small to diagnose the development as convergence around unilateralism My interviews of party informants indicate that this disillusionment persisted in 2007 although with slight variations While some had regrets others had concluded that party web sites should be reserved for information and marketing while digital political participation should take place in other foras outside the party web site Hence the paradox is that while Norway now has a near universal and highly competent population of internet users the average net surfer do not use the internet for political purposes Saglie and Vabo s 2005 166ff Karlsen 2008 xx and only a minority actually visits party web sites at all7 In short party websites have not become a success if internet traffic or political participation is the yardstick for success The interactive communication hoped for by early cyber democrats does not appear to be of high priority As such party web sites have evolved over time into the unilaterality now associated with Web 1 0 and do not utilize the interactive technologies In this sense Web 2 0 is shorthand for reintroduction of interactive elements most visibly as blogging Wikis My Space You Tube pod casting RSS and most recently Facebook As noted websites related to Web 2 0 rapidly became very popular in Norway Before the local elections of 2007 the political parties appear somewhat bewildered by the phenomenon of Web 2 0 indicating a similar stage at which they were around 1997 Most parties could be expected to present themselves as unitary parties along the lines they had eventually succeeded with on Web 1 0 On the other hand with the technology freely available for local parties activists and what might be classified as a serious ICT strategy and integrated ICT and the web as a normal part of the party s organisation Saglie 2006 xx 7 The main exception occurs ahead of elections when pupils and students are given assignments on political parties According to party informants the web sites have taken a considerable workload off party staff 8 sympathizers Web 2 0 represented a considerable challenge While some of the party informants were highly enthusiastic the majority expressed ambivalence opportunity AND nightmare or scepticism Web 2 0 was described as a media hype something that will pass and a place where people don t go for the politics Anyhow they were also aware that they could not control the development Established branding and copyright over domain names party names and even logos did not help much Web 2 0 was a new deal Individuals and groups were able to establish a presence using the name and even logos of the parties without the party s knowledge or consent8 As observed by one informant Until two years ago we thought it would suffice to own the domain www partyname no but now new places appear every day using our name and even our logo A lot of the people behind this are probably party members with good intentions but the result is that we have no control As noted the parties or individuals acting on their behalf with or without their knowledge or approval focused their establishment on a few national and transnational sites The next chapter reports on their activity in the blogosphere on Facebook and YouTube 6 Samples of Web 2 0 activity 6 1 Blogging A weblog is a webpage with one or several authors ideally with frequent updates the newest on top and open for comment As many politicians have discovered blogging is a demanding genre frequently ending in up in what is stigmatized in the media as blog flops In the fall of 2004 the leader of the Socialist left party Kristin Halvorsen started a personal weblog under much media attention Six months later she was heavily criticised for not being active enough and more or less gave up9 Since then political parties have mostly been hesitant towards systematically embracing blogging especially within the confines of their own web site The personal nature of political blogging makes gathering of systematic data a demanding task What is reported here on individual blogs builds upon information given by party informants in interviews blogs linked to through party web sites as well as reviews in the press In addition it reports from VG Blog which was the most ambitious attempt to mobilize systematic blogging from all parties on a single site during the 2005 and 2007 campaigns By the start of the campaign 2007 the parties lacked a coherent strategy towards the use of blogging The one exception was the Liberal party who built up and integrated individual blogs for politicians and individual members within their web site According to the party informant this was due to a combination of the 8 When party informants were asked about activity on web 2 0 as far as I know was a frequent addition to their statements 9 Se for instance Dagbladets judgments http www dagbladet no nyheter 2005 06 11 434408 html 9 liberal ideology providing individual members great freedom of expression as well as making a clear and visible distinction between the party as an institution and its policies on the one hand and the private opinions of individual politicians and members in general Furthermore an integrated blog function gave the party an opportunity to monitor discussions although with no editing or censorship By summer 2007 the party informant reported that this had worked very well Some of the other parties like the Labour party the Centre Party and the Red Electoral Alliance had incorporated blog functions on their web site but not implemented them The Conservatives The Christian People s Party and the Progress Party had decided they did not want a system where all politicians could blog within the confines of the party web site While there was awareness of the value of the direct and personal communication via blogging the stigma of highly visible blogs with little or no activity made them hesitate Of course those who wanted to blog had plenty of opportunities elsewhere outside the party web site and there was some top politicians blogs scattered around the internet especially from those in the younger cohorts Aftenposten Morgen 19 02 2007 As remarked by a leading young Social Left Party parliamentarian it provided a different type of channel I think blogging is a good opportunity to communicate with people and get responses from all camps It is a very nice way to express and test opinions in a simple and less formal manner It is less formal than for instance go through the newspapers Usually it is the last thing I do before I go to bed Its themes are politics Brann10 and the world Heikki HolmÃ¥s quoted in Aftenposten 19 02 2007 my translation These blogs tended to be personal in the sense that they were maintained by the politicians themselves and the contents reflected whatever they were preoccupied with at the time politics or something else11 But to my knowledge only one party leader blogged on a permanent basis Erna Solberg the leader of the Conservatives12 While the parties did not have a full overview of the blogosphere they recognized this as legitimate and did not wish to exercise any form of censorship In some instances they implemented harvesting strategies through highly visible linking to successful blogs The Socialist Left Party the Christian People s Party and the Labour Party put prominent links on their front pages directly to the blogs of people in the party leadership Furthermore the Democrats and the Liberals linked to a second page containing annotated links to several politicians 10 Brann is the local soccer team from HolmÃ¥s home town of Bergen See for instance Heikki HolmÃ¥s and Audun Lysbakken of the Socialist Left Party at http www heikki no and http rettvenstre no TorbjÃ¸rn RÃ¸e Isaksen of the Conservatives at http torbjorn ungehoyre no the Liberals Lars Henrik Michelsen at http michelsen blogs com and Ingrid Baltzersen of The Red Electoral Alliance at http baltzersen wordpress com 12 Erna Solberg blogs once a month on the NA24 which is a business news website at http ernasolberg nettblogg no The party also established a web diary for Solberg http www erna no but were very reluctant to call this a blog as readers could not post comments directly into the diary 11 10 blogs As noted above the Liberals blogs were contained within the main web site and offered the most extensive list During the election campaign personal blogs took on a quasi institutional and ad hoc character as the parties were more or less willingly pushed to take part in temporary blogging foras set up by the media The most ambitious was a special election blog section in the web edition of the leading newspaper VG both in the 2005 and 2007 election The responses of most of the party informants indicate that the parties were highly ambivalent about this On the one hand VG offered a blogging platform to all parties even for local party branches13 on the other hand they felt VG s ambitions were unrealistic But it gave party leaders the opportunity for high profile and short term or ad hoc blogging in the sense that they were not expected to continue after the election It should be noted that the leaders of the three of the smaller parties in the sample the Democrats the Pensioners Party and the Coast Party did not have their own blog on VG blogs14 Table xxx VG Blog Campaign Activity 1 August 10 September 2007 Postings and comments on party leader s blog PARTY Conservatives Progress Party Socialist

and activity in terms of postings or comments VG Blog The Socialist Left Party and the Liberals had the highest activity on both accounts indicating a higher e readiness in both party and target groups At the other end there is remarkably low activity from the Centre Party and the Progress Party 13 Se the invitation at http www vg no nyheter innenriks valg 2007 artikkel php artid 194804 The leader of the Coast Party did however blog on the local VG blog for the Oslo Party This appeared more or less to double as a national page Some scattered local activity on VG blog was also found for The Democrats 14 11 6 2 Facebook This subchapter focuses on the particular place Facebook established over a few months in the election year of 200715 The material on Facebook was gathered from May to December 2007 and gives a rough snapshot of the explosive and chaotic development of Norwegian party politics on Facebook in the campaign period Founded in February 2004 Facebook has grown to 67 million active users 4 years later http www facebook com press info php statistics Since January 2007 it grew with an average of 250 000 new registrations per day reaching the 20 million mark as recently as April 2007 Its unique popularity in Norway is reflected in the fact that this tiny country with a population of 4 5 million is a global number 8 in terms of active users Its unprecedented growth took the Norwegian parties by surprise and its character as a commercial networking site for individual users gave them a particular challenge16 However Facebook allowed individuals to set up special pages for particular groups and events to support or criticize another individual or entity Parties could therefore establish themselves as groups on Facebook and they appeared to be protected by the passage in the user terms stating that You may not set up a Facebook Page on behalf of another individual or entity unless you are authorized to do so On the other hand it is also stated that Facebook do not take any responsibility in this matter Another challenge is that Facebook as a platform for political networking may not be as appropriate for the Norwegian political landscape as the American landscape While use of the Norwegian language in postings etc is possible and adhered to in most instances the user interface is American English which may be intimidating for some But perhaps the most visible indicator is found within the options on political views in the user profile The range offered here are classical American ranging from Libertarian to Very Liberal via Conservative and Moderate Social democrat socialist Marxist anarchist or similar categories which are vital in the European and Norwegian political landscape are simply not offered Furthermore those belonging to these political views may be put off by the kind of targeted ads that have become more visible Still Norwegian users more or less invaded Facebook in early 2007 and the parties soon followed During spring and summer 2007 enthusiasts established mostly unofficial groups for their local party for local candidates and even for the national party This led to a jungle of groups most of them using the party logo and linking to the party but very few with any indicators whether they were the party s official group or not17 On the other hand party strategists knew Facebook was important for people At the national level there are several networking sites most of which are more specialised than Facebook For instance Gaysir http www gaysir no is vital for networking within the gay community Several activists and party members are established here 16 It is clearly stated in its terms of use http www facebook com terms php that one cannot register for more than one User account register for a User account on behalf of an individual other than yourself or register for a User account on behalf of any group or entity 17 As two following exchange between three contributors to the Wall of one of the groups imply 15 12 belonging to the younger cohorts of voters as well as activists But the efficiency of Facebook regarding political networking they knew little about A search on profiles of party leaders and vice leaders on Facebook indicate that top politicians were absent from Facebook18 Several groups for the national party organizations were established nonetheless However only a few were pure official groups indicated by linking from the main party web site The majority was semi official in the sense that they were established by local officers candidates or representatives In addition there were groups I choose to classify as unofficial as there were no or weak formal connections to the party They were simply the largest or only group dedicated to the party in question Table xx National party groups established on Facebook 2007 Party Official groups Conservatives Labour Party Centre Party Semi official groups Socialist Left Party

the date of the first posting in the group It should be noted that only two groups were established as official as the Centre Party group was first semi official and then sanctioned through a link on the party web site later Therefore 8 out of 10 groups representing the national party were established from below with or without the party organization s knowledge or consent First contributor To everyone as unattentive as myself who has joined the Facebook group party acronym this is not serious Get out not from this group but the fake one Second contributor The other party acronym group almost appeared a bit sick Third contributor I think it s better to talk with people rather than just run Of course problematic that anyone can establish Facebook groups and appear to be established by party acronym but they do not seem to have any bad intensions 18 Only a profile for one of the vice leaders of Red Electoral Alliance and the leader of the Centre Party was found 13 The Progress Party group is a case of particular interest being the by far largest group but established by persons who could not be identified among local candidates representatives or party officers presented on the party website Neither was there any mention of the group on the web site The founders of two other unofficial groups of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Democrats could at least be identified with the party through in their youth organizations Furthermore the party informants were aware of these groups and approved of their existence In general Facebook was a party political anarchy at the time of the election campaign in 2007 as there were myriads of groups over which the national parties felt they had little oversight or control Several parties discovered that a person already had established groups using the party name the party logo etc and henceforth appeared to an official group but was not On the other hand local and activist initiatives were appreciated although several of the informants expressed scepticism towards what they felt was Facebook hype As indicated by table xx all the groups were established in the period late March to early June 2007 leaving just one party The Pensioners Party unrepresented at the national level on Facebook But none of the groups had more than 1000 members except for the highly unofficial Progress party group Whether this is a large membership or not is debatable A group for a local Norwegian soccer team generates for instance a level of activity on Facebook on par with the largest Norwegian party19 6 3 YouTube YouTube was officially launched in December 2005 and rapidly established itself as the leader in online video where individuals easily could watch and share original streaming videos through a Web browser http www youtube com t fact_sheet Through the embeddable player videos posted on YouTube can easily be integrated within another web site for instance that of a political party YouTube can therefore be a free and simple way to store and deliver video content To upload videos and establish a Channel a personal user account is necessary although a public personal profile is not necessary The breakthrough of YouTube happened as part of the 2007 election campaign Although the political parties to some extent regarded this as part of the same hype as Facebook five of the national parties in the sample decided to use the opportunity to established channels on YouTube before the election The table below gives an overview of these parties 19 The biggest supporter group on Facebook for the soccer team Brann http www facebook com group php gid 2263527402 who won the Norwegian series last year had 738 members in the Norway network and 84 wall posts 14 Table xx Norwegian national party

July 9th 10 838 15 Source Party channels on YouTube December 12th 2007 In addition to these official national party channels there were a number of channels established by local parties and local activists But it all appeared to be less chaotic than what the party organizations experienced on Facebook The channel of the Oslo party branch of the Socialist left Party for instance included videos that were embedded into the national party web site An unofficial channel was run by a party member of the Red Electoral Alliance http www youtube comomicronline but was well regarded by the party informant as it provided a source for videos that could be embedded on the party web site The party name appeared to have little protection on YouTube as well as experienced by the Liberals When they were to establish their party channel on YouTube they discovered that the party name was already taken The Conservatives also stated that one important reason for establishing a channel on YouTube was quite simply to get the name for themselves As mentioned one attractive feature of YouTube is the capability for embedding of videos into other web pages For the political parties the implication was that a YouTube channel was not a competitor to the party web site Visitors to the web site could watch the videos without leaving the site almost seamlessly integrated along with other material As the Labour Party the Conservatives and the Centre Party already had invested in WebTV before the appearance of YouTube there was certain ambivalence Especially the Conservatives and the Centre Party downplayed the visibility of YouTube by not linking to their own channels on YouTube As shown in the table above these two parties were also the parties with the lowest activity on YouTube Hence previous investments in video technology may actually put investments on YouTube on hold The strategy of the Progress party not to establish any channel on YouTube at all and rely completely on their own FrpTV may be 15 regarded along the same lines YouTube might therefore become more important for parties and party branches with fewer resources as soon as they get to produce their own videos But some scepticism was expressed by some of the party informants towards putting up amateurish videos actually might be more harmful than no videos 7 A very preliminary discussion As illustrated by the parties experiences in establishing themselves on Web 2 0 introduction of new technologies implies a steep and not necessarily rational learning curve The hype cycle hypothesis Fenn and Linden 2005 Gartner Group 2007 describes the introduction and development of a new ICT in 5 phases20 Technology Trigger The technology becomes available although still underdeveloped Peak of Inflated Expectations High media visibility hype and the start of investments Trough of Disillusionment A collapse in media attention as the technology fails to deliver according to the hype Slope of Enlightenment Learning to take advantage of and further develop the technology The Plateau of Productivity The technology is mature While the hype cycle is a hypothesis of non rational behaviour in the first phases gradually giving way to rationality in later phases the concepts of institutionalised standards and isomorphism imply a different approach DiMaggio and Powell 1983 RÃ¸vik 1998 They refer to the tendency for certain organisational solutions to be established as best practice within a field leading to organisational homogeneity or convergence over time The advent of the technologies baptized as Web 2 0 got a lot of attention in the media from 2004 onwards and the parties clearly were unsure how to implement and take advantage of these technologies Both concepts may provide partial answers as far as parties felt pushed into using the new technologies because of the media hype and as far as they apparently did much the same on Web 2 0 But parties also embody variations in norms and values established routines and relations which may make them more or less resistant to any change or reform As Panebianco 1988 has reminded us of most parties are institutionalised actors acting in the shadow of their traditions and history values and coalitions of divergent interests Still one should be careful not to simply assume that the Web 2 0 is a revolutionary devices breaking down old institutions The effect may be differences in the form of implementation of Web 2 0 technology Compared to other established democracies it is remarkable how most of the major Norwegian parties have stuck with the mass party model identified by 20 This may well be applicable to political parties on the web although never applied by the Gartner Group themselves to this author s knowledge 16 Maurice Duverger 1954 Heidar and Saglie 2003b Norwegian parties stand out as stronger membership organizations than those in most other countries Mair and van Biezen 2001 9 12 Among the larger parties Socialist Left Party and the Progress Party appear to be the major deviations from the mass party model belonging to New Left and New Right Institutionalised parties similar to Duverger s mass party model 1954 could be expected to reproduce themselves on Web 2 0 as cyber mass parties rather than deinstitutionalised cyber parties along the Margetts 2001 2006 model How well this actually works within the context of a technology that is based on individual initiative and horizontal networking is an empirical question Parties of other types than the mass party may have a better fit to the technology model of Web 2 0 The new politics parties on the left and right can be expected to have the best fit with the Web 2 0 model One primary reason is that these parties mostly are new as organizations A relatively short history in itself implies a lower degree of institutionalization as well as the implication that these parties were formed within a different socio political context than mass parties Furthermore these parties tend towards stronger emphasis of individualism According to Kitschelt 1990 participation as a value in itself is vital for a leftlibertarian party type emphasising internal democracy and participation but much looser and less closed off than the mass party The new right parties are a disparate and changing entity Ignazi 1996 observes that the parties on the right did not exhibit anything similar to the new left rather what he called a caesaristic profile referring to the charismatic entrepreneurs and owners of these parties What they have in common is less weight upon party apparatus members or social classes and more upon communicating with citizens voters in general As such new right parties therefore may be more comfortable with the unilaterality of what is now associated with Web 1 0 rather than Web 2 0 The internet has also been regarded as providing opportunities to increase visibility and mobilize citizens voters for parties representing new or marginal groups or values Norris 2003 43 Katz and Mair 1995 claimed to observe a tendency towards increasing cartelisation of the party system in some West European countries Norway included The established parties controlled and shared public privileges which are essential for open party competition such as financial support and access to the mass media Competition from new or small parties outside such a cartel was therefore effectively kept to a minimum So the question is whether Web 2 0 technologies may provide smaller and newer parties with the means to become more visible The data indicate that to explain the volume of the activity on Web 2 0 party resources appear to be decisive either in terms of party organization resources or the resources of a large pool of activists and sympathizers If neither is present there is little activity To explain the form of activity the institutional factor or party type appears to be important Mass parties tend to go for an institutional approach while left libertarian parties are more inclined to leave the initiative to individual members and sympathizers Broadly speaking this would result in three different types of approaches 17 1 The institutional approach 2 The individual activist approach 3 Passive approach The institutionalist approach is where the party as an organization establishes itself officially on Web 2 0 allocating the necessary resources While the second category refers to parties where the initiative is left to activists with or without the party organization s knowledge or consent A passive approach occurs where there is little or no activity from both party organization and activists sympathizers In this category we would expect to find parties with little resources The best case for the institutionalist approach is the Labour party In a remarkable leap during a few months in the spring of 2007 the party became the only party that had an official national presence on the most popular sites of Web 2 0 Visitors to the official party web site during the 2007 campaign were directed to Facebook Flickr You Tube and VG Blog through clearly visible graphic links on the front page Furthermore it was the only national party on the most popular site for photos Flickr http www flickr com photos 8767358 N08 In a famous passage the Labour party was characterised as the eagle among Norwegian parties Seip 196x This referred to the internal coherence and strength of the organization its strong position among wage earners and its will and ability to hold government power As such it was the mass party per excellence The party has maintained much of its strength and has the resources and internal coherence to face and embrace new communication opportunities like no other parties It has also been remarkably open to use these opportunities According to the party informant some individuals in the party leadership had taken a great interest in the new forms of web 2 0 While not as pure a case as the Labour Party the Liberal party can also be classified in the institutionalist category But there was one significant difference While Labour did not pay much attention to official blogging outside VG Blog the Liberals pioneered the incorporation of blogging technology inside the confines of the party web site itself as early as 2005 Unlike Labour the Liberals had an ideological dilemma attached to their approach given their high ideological profile of individualism and local autonomy So while the party showed an institutional approach there was considerable individual activism on Web 2 0 with or without the party s official approval and knowledge This is not surprising as the party frequently has been classified along the Socialist Left Party as a representative of new politics values of participative democracy The individualist activist approach seemed to sit well with The Socialist Left Party While they appreciated Web 2 0 as opening up for new ways of communication the party relied on harvesting through linking to a selection of individual blogs local branches initiating Facebook groups and embedding of YouTube videos made by local party branches However the level of activity is a bit too low to fully support the left libertarian activist approach Furthermore the behaviour of the Conservative party seems to escape escapes any simple explanation The Conservatives have taken pride in being at the technological forefront as an institution But the party appeared to be sceptical to 18 enter Web 2 0 as ambitions were focused on having a professional party website delivering relevant information on the party Although Web 2 0 was partly regarded as hype another reason was that the party did not want to interfere in political activity here Given the multitude of channels that opened for political discussions the party did not see the necessity to establish foras on its own Furthermore the party informant felt that if the party established its own foras top down users would shy away Networking is an individual and voluntary grassroots activity unfit for an institutional top down approach In this sense there were clear ideological differences between Labour and the Conservatives The party regarded individual and local activity as very positive but did not want to interfere as an organization Our study also shows considerable individual activism on Web 2 0 The Progress Party was the only parliamentary party that had no official pages on Web 2 0 at all21 but otherwise resembled the Conservatives in approach For the party as an organization the web was primarily regarded as a platform for marketing and distributing information This might indicate a distinct right wing pattern where the party organizations shy away from Web 2 0 technologies as these technologies are based on individuality and horizontal networking and the party organization is focused on professional marketing of the party As for the other parties resources appeared to be the main barrier even for the Centre Party and the Christian People s Party These parties and of course the small parties outside parliament even more felt that they had to focus on Web 1 0 i e the party web site in a situation with scarce resources But almost all of the smaller parties had managed some local or unofficial presence established by activists and sympathisers The Red Electoral Alliance had the highest activity as could be expected from being the largest and most established of the small parties as well as from its leftist activist ideology The one exception with no recorded activity at all was the Pensioners party whose target groups also belonged to the most disconnected age groups At the moment it appears that Web 2 0 do not have any pluralising effect on party visibility networking and activism demands resources in the form of a number of activists Maintaining web sites on Web 1 0 may be a less demanding task The question whether Web 2 0 did enhance participatory democracy by lowering the threshold for involvement of party grassroots and sympathisers during the 2007 campaign cannot be given any final answer here But as the party organization at least temporarily lost some control to local and individual intiatives it might appear so although the number of people involved might be too small to call it a catalyst of digital participatory democracy 21 Although they represent an interesting deviant case as their youth organisation apparently was the only party political organizations established on
