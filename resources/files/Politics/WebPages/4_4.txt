week at the UN President Obama embarked on a campaign for progress with Iran that will prove much more dangerous for American interests Just as Vladimir Putin had played him for a fool over Syria Barack Obama was initially snubbed by Iranian President Hassan Rowhani despite frantic White House efforts to produce a handshake On Friday after a brief Obama Rowhani telephone call Obama said that a comprehensive solution between countries is possible And this despite the previous day s meeting of foreign ministers including Secretary of State John Kerry and Iran s Mohammad Javad Zarif that was little more than a photo op Obama s yearning fits smoothly into the PR campaign by President Rowhani Iran s new frontman The campaign has included showcasing Iran s only Jewish parliamentarian a staunch opponent of Israel offering dialogue with the West catnip for the gullible and a soothing Washington Post op ed Separating propaganda hype and disinformation from Iran s real objectives is critical Unfortunately too many already believe that Rowhani s election marked a substantive rather than a cosmetic policy shift Instead of blustering about Iran s nuclear program and threatening Israel Rowhani has sounded conciliatory carefully using his first weeks in office to cloud Western memories of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad President Rowhani knows what his Western audience wants to hear As Iran s chief nuclear negotiator in 2003 05 he followed the same playbook and it worked By offering what appeared to be concessions Iran acquired precious time and legitimacy to overcome scientific and technical glitches in its nuclear weapons program In articles and speeches Rowhani boasted of his successes In 2006 he taunted the West saying by creating a calm environment we were able to complete the work on uranium conversion facility Isfahan Even such open disdain has not triggered enough US or European embarrassment to protect against being suckered again Iran s moderates are now targeting the Obama soft spot in Western opposition to Iran s nuclear program and methodically exploiting it In marked contrast Obama enters negotiations gravely weakened by his Syria failures Yet soothed by his media choir he seems unaware how deeply he has been wounded He confidently believes he is well placed to deal with the ayatollahs despite a series of foreign policy failures Over the past year Obama failed in his stated objective to oust Syria s Assad regime from power failed to impress Assad that his red line against using chemical weapons was serious failed to exact retribution when that red line was crossed failed to rally anything but small minorities in either house of congress to support his position and failed to grasp that agreements with the likes of Syria and Russia prolong rather than solve the chemical weapons problem Obama is inverting Dean Acheson s maxim that Washington should only negotiate from strength Even if there were some prospect that Iran could be talked out of its nuclear weapons program which there is not the White House approach is the wrong way to start discussions Given the President s palpable unwillingness to use the military to enforce his Syria red line let alone to answer last year s September 11 Benghazi terrorist attack and his paucity of domestic political support Iran s ayatollahs know that the President s all options on the table incantation regarding their nuclear program carries no weight Iran undoubtedly wants relief from international sanctions which have exacerbated decades of incompetent economic policy But there is no evidence that the sanctions have impaired Iran s nuclear or ballistic missile programs Instead Tehran has increased its financial and military assistance to Assad and Hezbollah in Syria Rowhani s strategy is clear lower the rhetorical temperature about the nuclear issue make temporary cosmetic concessions such as allowing inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency at already declared nuclear sites and gain Western acceptance of its reactor grade uranium enrichment Once that goal is attained Iran s path to nuclear weapons will be unobstructed Iran will demand in return that international sanctions be eased focusing first on obtaining small reductions to signal Western good faith Obama and Europe already seem eager to comply Western diplomats will assert defensively that these concessions are merely a matter of sequencing and that they expect substantive Iranian concessions They will wait a long time Rowhani fully understands that once sanctions start rolling back restoring them will be hard perhaps impossible Rowhani will not supply a major provocation Instead he will continue making on again off again gestures seducing the West into protracted negotiations Meanwhile Iran s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs will proceed unimpeded in unknown undisclosed locations This was his 2003 05 playbook Extended negotiations will enable Obama to argue that a diplomatic process is under way to resolve the Iranian nuclear threat No phrase is more beloved at the State Department Obama will then use this process on Israel to prevent pre emptive military action against Iran s nuclear program In time even Hamlet came to understand that one may smile and smile and be a villain Maybe one day President Obama will figure it out See more at
