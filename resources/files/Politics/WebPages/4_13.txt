ABC News Photo Barack Obama says a Congress vote will be delayed while a diplomatic solution is sought AFP Evan Vucci Related Story Russia plan on Syria was no accident US official Related Story Obama says Russia s proposal on Syria s chemical weapons potentially positive Map Syrian Arab Republic United States president Barack Obama has vowed to pursue a diplomatic initiative from Russia over Syria s chemical weapons use but voiced scepticism about it and urged Americans to support his threat to use military force Mr Obama used a nationally televised address to Americans to denounce last month s gas attack which the US says killed 1 400 Syrians describing it as sickening and a danger to national security He stated his case for military action saying president Bashar al Assad must be brought to account or he will use chemical weapons again When dictators commit atrocities they depend on the world to look the other way until those horrifying pictures fade from memory Mr Obama said The question now is what the United States of America and the international community is prepared to do about it Key points Barack Obama asks Congress to delay vote on military action in Syria Says plan to have Syria hand over its chemical weapons should be explored Says US military remains on standby as inaction is not an option Because what happened to those people to those children is not only a violation of international law it s also a danger to our security However Mr Obama said he had asked Congress to delay a vote on military action while a Russian initiative was explored further Analysis from The Drum We are seeing the diminished power of the US after Iraq Russia yesterday seized on an off the cuff comment from US secretary of state John Kerry that Syria place its chemical weapons stockpile under international control Russia said it would work with Syria to make this happen and Syria has already expressed a willingness to comply with the plan Mr Obama said he would discuss the initiative further with Russian president Vladimir Putin but expressed scepticism about whether it would succeed He said he would work with France Britain China and Russia on a United Nations resolution requiring Mr Assad to give up his chemical weapons Read what ABC News readers thought of Barack Obama s address advocating military action on Syria Any agreement must verify that the Assad regime keeps its commitments Mr Obama said But this initiative has the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons without the use of force particularly because Russia is one of Assad s strongest allies How would Syria hand over its chemical weapons How might a plan to take Syria s chemical weapons out of president Bashar al Assad s hands actually work Europe correspondent Mary Gearin asked Hamish de Bretton Gordon a former commanding officer at the UK s Joint Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Regiment The draft resolution gives Syria 15 days to make a complete declaration of its entire chemical arms program and demands UN weapons inspectors be given immediate access to all sites named in the declaration It would also demand inspectors be granted access to all chemical arms personnel records and equipment The resolution threatens Syria with further necessary measures in the event of non compliance In what amounted to the most explicit high level admission by Syria that it has chemical weapons foreign minister Walid al Moualem said earlier in a statement shown on Russian state television that Damascus was committed to the Russian initiative We want to join the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons he said We are ready to observe our obligations in accordance with that convention including providing all information about these weapons We are ready to declare the location of the chemical weapons stop production of the chemical weapons and show these production facilities to representatives of Russia and other United Nations member states Obama says US inaction is not an option Mr Obama used much of his speech to lay out the case against Syria saying there was plenty of evidence showing the Syrian government was behind the deadly attack The US military doesn t do pinpricks Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver US president Barack Obama He argued that Syria should face consequences for using such weapons because much of the world has long since adopted a ban on chemical weapons He said if the civilised world did nothing to respond it would only embolden US adversaries Mr Obama said he understood Americans were weary of costly conflicts abroad following the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq but he was of the belief that America could not sit back while chemical weapons were being used in flagrant violation of international law And amid confusion about the extent of any US military strike he said that Mr Assad would pay a heavy price if military action was used The US military doesn t do pinpricks he said Chemical weapons in Syria Syria is understood to have the third largest stockpile of chemical weapons in the world including sarin and other nerve gases Amid accusations by Syrian activists that forces loyal to president Bashar al Assad have used nerve gas to kill more than 200 people we look back over similar allegations made during the conflict Even a limited strike will send a message to Assad that no other nation can deliver Mr Obama said the Assad regime did not have the capability to seriously threaten the US military He repeated his earlier pledge that any military action would be limited in both its scope and duration and would not involve American boots on the ground He said he had ordered the US military to be ready to respond if diplomacy fails Mr Kerry and defence secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress earlier that the threat of military action was critical to forcing Mr Assad to bend on his chemical weapons For this diplomatic option to have a chance of succeeding the threat of a US military action the credible real threat of US military action must continue Mr Hagel told the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee Mr Obama said Mr Kerry would meet Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Thursday for further talks
