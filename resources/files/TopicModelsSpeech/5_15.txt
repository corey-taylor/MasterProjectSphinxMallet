Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 ORIGINAL ARTICLE Design and implementation of a VoiceXML driven wiki application for assistive environments on the web Constantinos Received 31 December 2008 Accepted 5 October 2009 Published online 12 March Abstract In this paper we describe the design and implementation of an audio wiki application accessible via both the Public Switched Telephone Network and the Internet The application exploits mature World Wide Web Consortium standards such as VoiceXML Speech Synthesis Markup Language and Speech Recognition Grammar Specification toward achieving our goals The purpose of such an application is to assist visually impaired technologically uneducated and underprivileged people in accessing information originally intended to be accessed visually via a personal computer PC Users may access wiki content via fixed or mobile phones or via a PC using a Web Browser or a Voice over IP service This feature promotes pervasiveness to collaboratively created content to an extremely large population i e those who simply own a telephone line Keywords C Kolias Abbreviations ABNF Augmented 1 Introduction Wikis are generally considered as collaboration platforms where users access or contribute knowledge on specific topics Wikis are mostly implemented as web applications that allow registered and sometimes even unregistered 123 528 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 users to create edit hyperlink and organize their content Wiki applications are also used in many companies to provide effective Intranets and for knowledge management Beyond doubt the huge success of Wikipedia 1 which is perhaps the most famous wiki application nowadays proves in practice the suitability of wikis in exchanging knowledge The idea that wiki applications enable the collaborative writing of articles of common interest is simple enough yet this simplicity entails a profound impact on the flow of information among their users Their general philosophy is the facilitation of access and contribution to knowledge However their collaborative and in many cases open nature raises important issues such as accessibility content validity and security 2 In most of the existing wiki implementations access is as simple as browsing on a simple web page Editing is also straightforward and it can be done by inserting information written in a specific usually very simple syntax in the appropriate web forms that the wiki interface offers Since wiki content can be changed by anyone depending on the implementation its validity is consigned either to the users themselves or to specific users who are considered as experts As far as security is concerned it is typically achieved by utilizing standard security mechanisms to accomplish authorization authentication and integrity in order to relate changes of wiki content with specific users or to ensure that the presented information is original Most of the existing wiki implementations are primarily dependent on web standards such as the Hypertext Markup Language HTML HTML represents information in a visual manner and as a result visually impaired individuals are unable to access their content Beyond doubt the vast majority of modern web applications neglect the special needs of disabled people Until now visually impaired individuals rely on the features of the operating system they use e g ShowSounds for the Windows XP operating system While these features comprise a typical feature of most of the modern operating systems they lack of support for dynamically generated content such as content originating from the World Wide Web Such individuals are limited in using high cost systems that often require special training as well A fundamental requirement of using wiki applications is having some sort of access to the Internet This automatically makes access to its content prohibited to a large population such as various semi literate and illiterate people in cities and rural areas of emerging economies or technologically uneducated people such as the elderly Thus the inability of underprivileged people to afford computers or web enabled handheld devices as well as the disinterest of some people to acquire basic information technology IT skills lead to an undesirable blockade to a large amount of knowledge Since wikis share a large amount of information among different people the need to be accessible from the widest range of devices possible is immanent However the integration of wikis to personal digital assistants PDAs or smartphones is rather complicated This is due to the great number of different standards technologies and operating systems that exist for such devices in the market today Web based wiki implementations are usually developed focusing on desktop scale HTML based browsers This fact generates many problems when wiki content is accessed from mobile devices equipped with browsers supporting certain subsets of standard HTML like Wireless Markup Language WML 3 or i Mode HTML 4 Speech is the most natural and innate communication means available to people and when exploited it maximizes the effectiveness of 2 Previous work During the recent past numerous efforts have been made to acoustically access information which was originally intended to be accessed visually Applications were developed motivated by the need to aid visually impaired 123 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 529 individuals and at the same time serve population who do not afford access to the Internet In 6 a Wiki application similar to the one described in this paper is presented It is based on the observation that mobile phones have penetrated more than the Internet into young people becoming a fashion and in some countries like the developing ones has clearly dominated over it Under this assumption the proposed wiki service waits for a short message service SMS signal from the user s mobile phone with the title of the article he wishes to hear After a while the service calls the user to his mobile phone and speaks the article content via a synthetic voice During the call the user can navigate to the different sections of the article by pressing keys in his phone The application is totally based on open source software components such as MediaWiki 7 This application is addressed to students in emerging economies who usually are not familiarized with the use of PCs or simply cannot afford one On the other hand the fact that such a wiki is based on a mobile phone feature it makes it inaccessible to people e g the elderly who do not own one or cannot or do not know how to send an SMS Although mobile phones are very popular nowadays ordinary Public Switched Telephone Network PSTN phones are still used by the majority of people In 8 authors propose a client server architecture to integrate speech technology into web pages to be used for e learning purposes The production of voice to text and vice versa is done on a central speech server where the services speech synthesis speech recognition and speaker verification are installed The content produced is presented to the user in a web browser in which is embedded a Java applet that implements audio input and output capabilities However the only requirement on the client side for this approach i e a JavaScript enabled browser and Sun s Java plugin is uncertain to be supported by current mobile devices Additionally access to the Internet is not guaranteed when the user is on the move or simply when he does not have an Internet connection or a PC In 9 authors claim that the collaborative nature of wikis is not well served because it limits its users to computer environments or when deployed in mobile environments it restricts them by means of input keyboard stroke or stylus and output small screen They identify that synchronous communication technologies like teleconferences or simple calls are gaining attention as channels to carry out collaborative tasks Therefore the combination of the wiki collaboration paradigm with audio communication means can improve the overall usability of wikis Under this context they propose a wiki implementation to facilitate asynchronous audio mediated collaboration when on the move It is based solely on the manipulation of audio files Despite the fact that it enhances collaboration with a more personalized feeling each user contributes with his own voice this implementation does not have any web counterpart and therefore it cannot be accessed by any means other than acoustic In 10 a non visual web browser is presented It enables visually impaired people to navigate contents of web pages acoustically A synthetic speech feature transforms the contents of web pages into sound and the open source Sphinx voice recognition engine 11 transforms the user s voice into signals which are recognized by the system In this way one can navigate through pages with his voice only and can avoid the sequential narration of their content This application provides significant advantages especially to partially blind users who are not willing to invest time and effort to learn new communication means or acquire IT skills On the other hand it runs exclusively on PCs making it inaccessible to users who do not own or do not know how to use a computer In addition there is no lightweight version targeting to mobile devices making it inappropriate for roaming users thus reducing its pervasiveness DAISY Consortium 12 is an organization the mission of which is to develop integrate and promote standards technologies and implementation strategies to enable global access by people with reading disabilities to information provided by mainstream publishers governments and libraries A DAISY Digital Talking Book DTB is a file with a specific format which can be accessed either from an appropriate software in a PC or from a special device with DTB playback capability Though feasible to integrate this approach in a wiki platform would require a conversion of the material to this specific format Unlike VoiceXML DTB is not a widely adopted standard and therefore it is not appropriate for developers or suitable for dynamic systems like wikis Additionally from a user s point of view DTB requires software which in turn requires a PC and the related skills or a special device Both lead to extra costs for the end user 3 Related standards Our proposed application is based on VoiceXML in order to become accessible acoustically by a standard phone or by a computer Besides VoiceXML our application exploits the power of more relative W3C standards such as SRGS 13 and SSML 14 in order to increase the overall effectiveness of the application and enhance the end user experience Hereunder we present a brief description of each one of these standards 3 1 VoiceXML VoiceXML is an eXtensible Markup Language XML based language that aims to function as a tool for the 123 530 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 development of interactive special elements called dialogs which control the flow of voice applications Each dialog specifies the next dialog or document that the call will transit to by using Universal Resource Identifiers URIs If a dialog does not specify a successor then the execution is terminated Dialogs can be forms or menus Forms are used for presenting information and accepting user input while menus are used for presenting the user with a set of choices and transits to the appropriate dialog based on the result of the user choice Table 1 presents a sample of a basic VoiceXML document in which bold and italic text style represents embedded SRGS and SSML elements respectively Each dialog must have one or more grammar files associated with it Grammars contain lists of words that the interpreter may consider valid during the time a user uses that specific dialog Speech and or DTMF grammar files exist for recognizing voice commands or digital tones as user input respectively The role of grammar files is very important for the development of dialogs and a different W3C recommendation exists to specify their structure and purpose In the following paragraph we elaborate on grammars 3 2 SRGS The speech recognition grammar specification SRGS is a W3C recommendation for the creation of grammar documents within 123 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 xml version 1 0 vxml version 2 0 xmlns http www w3 org 2001 vxml form block prompt Welcome to the emphasis Voice Wiki emphasis break time 500ms Please provide a category grammar rule id category one of item history item item science item item environment item one of rule grammar prompt block form vxml 531 when the expected terms may change be added amended or deleted very often This is the case for the proposed wiki application in which the article names that the user may search for change frequently Currently there are two main formats for writing SRGS grammar files Augmented implementation SSML tags are relatively small in number thus SSML code is embedded in the VoiceXML file 4 System architecture Figure 1 depicts a high level view of the system architecture The proposed system is comprised of four major components Database The database is a key system s architecture component in which application data are stored and from where they are retrieved It holds information regarding the contents of the articles their previous versions the registered users the users who have the privileges to create new articles etc The complexity of the database scheme is kept low It is stressed that the content of the articles is stored in the database mixed with presentation information The latter are nothing but special sequences of characters usually referred to as wikitext that a user inserts during the editing of an article Web server On the web server resides the Wiki engine which is a web application responsible for the following tasks 1 To constantly wait for the user s requests either from a web browser thus starting a web page session or from a voice browser thus starting a voice session 123 532 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 Fig 1 System architecture 2 3 4 5 To communicate with the database to retrieve or update article data In the case of voice session the wiki engine has to generate a dynamic grammar of the available article titles one of which will be the user s choice for presentation In a wiki application the number of existing articles and as a result the terms that the user is expected to ask for might take large proportions That would lead to the generation of a large grammar file which would affect the overall performance of the system and consequently the user s overall experience For this reason articles are categorized and the user is requested to first choose the category of the article and then ask for the article s title In this way grammar files are kept smaller To transform wikitext sequences retrieved from the database either in XHTML in the case of a web page session or in VoiceXML in the case of a voice session An example of the transformation of wikitext into XHTML or VoiceXML is presented in Table 2 To send the generated XHTML files to the user s web browser or the VoiceXML files to the system s Voice Server for further processing 4 time it may forward the text meant to be spoken to the TTS engine Generates the request made by the user and forwards it to the web server Voice server The voice server is the component responsible for the transformation of text documents to audio data The voice server consists of a voice browser a TTS engine and an Automatic Speech Recognition ASR engine Additionally a VoIP gateway is an additional component that plays an important role during the transformation but is not an actual component of the voice server itself The voice browser 1 2 3 Accepts request from the user and in response proceeds to the appropriate actions Receives VoiceXML and grammar files from the web server Specifies the execution flow according to the instructions in the VoiceXML file For instance at a given The TTS engine receives the text from the VoiceXML file meant to be spoken transforms it into streaming sound and sends it to the VoIP gateway to forward it to the enduser On the other hand the ASR engine receives a grammar which is a set of terms that is able to recognize along with the client prompt and identifies if the prompt corresponds to any word in the grammar If true it returns the term textually The VoIP gateway receives calls from the PSTN converts PSTN signals to VoIP signals and forwards them to the voice server It is to be noted that the voice server will accept only VoIP signals Signals originating from the Internet from VoIP clients might be Session Initiation Protocol SIP 17 signals e g from Xlite softphone or signals of some proprietary VoIP protocol like Skype The VoIP gateway is also responsible for the transformation of VoIP signals from the Internet to the protocol that the voice server recognizes The web server and voice server components are depicted in Fig 2 Clients The system might accept different types of clients A client may be a typical web browser installed on the user s PC or PDA for instance Firefox Internet Explorer or IE mobile It might also be a VoIP client program installed on a PC like Skype Finally a client might be a fixed telephone or a wireless one that places its request through a PSTN network 4 1 Implementation aspects In the proposed application the MS SQL Server 2005 18 was used to store the wiki data A wiki engine application was developed on ASP NET scripts MS Speech Server 2007 was selected for the voice server MS Speech Server contains a powerful TTS engine as well as an advanced ASR engine The application was tested with the Xlite 123 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 WikiText Local Area Network Contents History Technical aspects See also References

and adaptive features to the application Users through the web interface could specify which content they would like to hear via phone and save time when they access it Additionally the application itself could create user profiles by keeping each user s browsing history and infer which content they consider interesting and which not Then the application could automatically present the content that is considered interesting and hide the irrelevant one Other features that could enhance the end user s experience could be VoiceXML WikiText HTML Document Voice Browser Grammar Text GrXML TTS Engine Voice ASR Engine Voice Fig 2 Web server and voice server components softphone 3 0 Since this particular software utilizes the SIP protocol and Speech Server 2007 requires the messages to be in SIP as well the use of VoIP gateway was not necessary The proposed wiki implementation converts article text to audio on the voice server and sends it to the client through the Internet or the PSTN This fact revokes the need for a voice browser with a TTS engine or any other software that performs analogous tasks to be installed on the client s PC Also it enables clients to access the wiki content via a phone However the client will receive voice streams instead of simple VoiceXML documents Normally voice streams have a large size resulting to longer response delays Also the architecture may have large implementation costs because it requires additional hardware and commercial software like TTS and ASR engines One aspect that should be taken into account is that the twofold nature of this implementation may raise various considerations regarding its effectiveness Audio as a temporal medium cannot be concurrently presented in contrast to text which can be presented in parallel At the same time grammar files can contain a small amount of terms and this may downscale the searching feature Therefore users when accessing an article via telephone they have to hear its content sequentially in order to find a unit of interest something that significantly deteriorates the overall user experience An approach to deal with this 123 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 535 integrates all these functions and thus collaboration or interface problems may occur when all these components are put together 4 2 Real life scenarios In this paragraph we present a scenario of a typical Table 3 Sample giving specific navigation commands such as BEGIN NEXT PREVIOUS 1 2 etc At any point the user is able to listen to the user manual by speaking the command HELP This case of course is very similar when a visitor of a museum wants to quickly know some additional details about the museum exhibits but has no laptop or internet connection He can use his cell phone to acquire this information wirelessly Table 3 presents a typical dialog like the one described above between a user and the application When a request is sent to the web server the wiki engine analyzes it and produces the appropriate query to retrieve the corresponding data from the database Using these data it creates the appropriate VoiceXML and grammar documents When a call is made to the voice server by a standard or mobile phone it starts to interact with its voice browser component Just like a normal web browser the voice browser places a request to the web server for a document containing the information requested The web server responds with a dynamically produced content Unlike the usual case where the web server produced an XHTML document in this case the server produces VoiceXML and grammar documents The voice browser receives it interprets the XML markup and redirects the result to its TTS engine component The TTS engine produces audio stream based on the results it received The voice server then converts the audio signals to packets according to a VoIP protocol such as SIP or to analog voice signals with the help of the appropriate hardware Welcome to the Voice Wiki Say HELP

component installed on it If the client makes the call from a SIP soft phone then the voice data will be carried through the Internet to reach the client If the client makes the call from a fixed phone then the voice signals will be carried through the PSTN network instead Of course if the access to the wiki is done from a web browser then normal HTML pages will be generated and sent to the browser for display Figure 3 depicts the corresponding article as presented in the web browser 5 System evaluation Voice quality in VoIP systems is a multi dimensional and a non trivial problem For such measurements two kind of evaluation methods exist The subjective based methods in which speech samples are presented to an evaluation group of listeners who rate the quality of the vocal information using an integer opinion score All scores are then averaged to produce a mean opinion score MOS value 21 Subjective tests are highly reliable yet they are time consuming costly and the results may be biased to human perspective and the different test settings Thus the objective based testing methods have been developed as a solution for effectively measuring voice quality and dealing in parallel with all these issues These methods consist of algorithms carried out by devices involved in the VoIP architecture and do not require any intervention from evaluators Objective tests are further categorized in the intrusive and non intrusive methods based on whether a reference voice signal is used or not respectively In this paper we used a non intrusive objective evaluation method calculating parameters of the ITU T Recommendation G 107 Protocol also known as E model 22 Fig 3 The wiki application accessed from a web browser 123 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 537 E model was developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute ETSI and adopted by International Telecommunication Union ITU In the objectivebased methods several QoS parameters and metrics are involved for measuring voice quality such as the signal tonoise ratio SNR packet delays and inter arrival variations jitter etc Through these international standardized metrics the protocol provides a transmission rating factor R factor which varies between 0 and 100 and can be then interpreted in several subjective evaluation values such as the commonly used MOS value Equation 1 provides the estimated MOS value when using the objective E model through the calculated R factor defined in Equation 2 where Ro is a basic SNR value Is Id and Ie are metrics dedicated for the calculation of distortions that occurred in the voice signal combination impairment factor distortions caused by end to end delays and echoing delay impairment factor as well as distortions caused by for instant feedback even when traffic load or device parameters vary 23 For real time acquisition of the parameters and metrics needed we use CommView which is a tool capable for realtime monitoring in Internet and local area networks LANs as well as in analyzing activity of captured data network packets http www tamos com products commview Table 4 depicts the results in average values regarding a set of evaluation experiments conducted for measuring the call quality of our system The evaluation procedure was performed as follows We used 45 individuals separated in three groups namely A B and C each consisted of 15 users Group A and C consisted of VoIP users while Group B consisted of telephone users who either use PSTN or a mobile telephone During the first sets of experiments we recorded the averaged values of the Rfactor the available bandwidth of the voice server as well as the jitter between the two communication parts when a single VoIP session was performed from each user We then performed the same voice sessions for additional 10 times by generating traffic in the voice server through protocols UDP TCP and ICMP This was made in order to assess the performance of our system under different network stressing conditions The size of the generated packets was 42 54 and 106 Bytes for UDP TCP and ICMP protocols respectively while their generation rate was 30 packets s In the second set of evaluation the user groups involved used either a PSTN and VoIP call or a call from a mobile phone and VoIP call Group B and A respectively Calls were performed virtually simultaneously However since we were not able to measure the voice quality the users received through telephone calls we asked from the users to use the 5 points MOS scale for their evaluation Finally the experiments ended with the evaluation made for three simultaneously VoIP calls from users of Group A and Group C Thus the total amount of separate experiments conducted for voice quality evaluation over different context and networking conditions were 270 90 for single Table 4 Averaged call quality evaluation results Call context Evaluation parameters No stress i TCP Udp ii ICMP TCP iii ICMP UDP

for two simultaneous calls of different context and 90 for two simultaneous VoIP calls The values depicted in Table 4 are averaged values from 10 different experiments Figures 4 5 and 6 illustrate the averaged values for all three different kind of experiments explained above It was evaluated that in most cases R factor was not significantly influenced by traffic or stressing network conditions However a significant reduce of the R factor was measured when three users called simultaneously under the heaviest stressing condition ICMP TCD and UDP traffic generation Fig 4 case v Now as far as jitter is concerned Fig 5 clearly shows that this metric is totally correlated with the amount of simultaneous calls and or calls of different context as its averaged values considerably increases in all cases Once again the larger increase appeared in case v Finally Fig 6 shows that the percentage of available bandwidth presents a similar behavior in respect to the R factor variation and an inverse analogous relation with jitter variation in all cases available bandwidth pstn mobile voip 2 users Fig 6 Jitter evaluation over call context and traffic load R Factor evaluation 100 95 90 85

slope in the R factor reduction is notably lower in comparison to the one of the available bandwidth in cases i ii iii and iv It was assessed that even if the available bandwidth fall down nearly 10 at the most in all three separate experiments 84 61 to 74 58 68 21 to 59 67 and 69 41 to 62 24 respectively R factor averaged values were dropped only by 2 units at the most 93 3 to 91 4 91 to 90 and 90 8 to 89 1 This was very encouraging indicating that our system is quite robust when it comes to provide high quality vocal services with two simultaneously calls It was also worth noticing that even if three users used simultaneously our system R factor was measured in acceptable levels even when some stressing network conditions were applied see cases i ii iii and iv in the last column of Table 4 In these cases R factor varied between 90 8 and 89 6 4 2 to 4 0 in the MOS scale Problems appeared when three simultaneous calls were made and the voice server was severely stressed with ICMP TCP and UDP generated packets In that case R factor was measured at the levels of 83 4 in average Even though this number is not so low for having an acceptable communication some users claimed that they did not clearly hear the system generated voice probably due to lower R factor values In other words this means that our system is capable of serving two users simultaneously at any call context Three users may also be supported but subject to no heavy stressing network conditions 6 Conclusions and future work In this paper a novel wiki application that can be accessed by virtually any wired or wireless phone as well as by a common web browser was presented By doing so a strong tool for collaboration such as a wiki was made accessible from practically everywhere Our application can equally support similar collaboration tools like Blikis iii iv v voip 3 users pstn mobile voip 2 users Fig 5 Jitter evaluation over call context and traffic load 123 Pers Ubiquit Comput 2010 14 539 8

computing vol 2 ITCC 2004 24 and other emerging tools like Twitters 25 Since common telephones are installed in almost every home our application can bring wikis closer to a wider range of people who do not own or are not comfortable with the use of a PC The advantages of the proposed implementation over similar existing implementations are a it does not require installation of special software or a PC for someone to listen to wiki articles b it is cost efficient for the end user and c it accepts voice commands for navigation throughout articles and for controlling the application flow Currently we are focusing our efforts on creating a voice interface that will interact with the user in a more immediate way so that the user will spend as less time as possible searching locating and navigating throughout the various articles For that purpose we are exploring various adaptive hypermedia techniques in order to proactively adapt the content of articles to each user s likings The use of a more natural language for the interaction with the user is also desirable References 1 http www wikipedia org 2 Kolias C Demertzis S Kambourakis G 2008 Design and implementation of a secure
