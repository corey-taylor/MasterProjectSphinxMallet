J Am Acad Audiol 17 The Effects of Speech and Speechlike Maskers on Unaided and Aided Speech Recognition in Persons with Hearing Loss Benjamin W Y Hornsby Todd A Ricketts Earl E Johnson Abstract Speech understanding in noise is affected by both the energetic and informational masking components of the background noise In addition when the background noise is everyday speech the relative contributions of the energetic and informational masking components to the overall difficulties in understanding speech are unclear This study estimated informational masking effects in conversational speech settings on the speech understanding of persons with and without hearing loss The benefits and limitations of amplification in settings containing both informational and energetic masking components were also explored Speech recognition was assessed in the presence of two types of maskers speech and noise that varied in the amount of informational masking they were expected to produce Persons with hearing loss were tested both unaided and aided Study results suggest that background noise consisting of individual talkers results in both informational and energetic masking In addition the benefits of amplification are limited when the background noise contains both informational and energetic masking components Key Words Hearing aids hearing loss informational masking

speech understanding of persons with hearing impairment are well documented e g Van Tasell 1993 Humes 2002 Although improving audibility through amplification can result in improvements in speech understanding in noise the benefits are often less than that observed for persons without hearing loss listening under conditions of comparable audibility Plomp 1986 Rankovic 1991 Ching et al 1998 Turner and Henry 2002 Hornsby and Ricketts 2003 This difficulty understanding in noise is due largely to the masking effects of the background competition When listening to speech in a background of noise consisting of other talkers at least two types of masking may occur The most welldescribed masking effects originate in the auditory periphery i e cochlea or proximal portions of the auditory nerve and occur when the excitation or neural response in a given frequency range due to the target is less than that produced by the background noise This type of masking has been referred to as energetic masking and its effects on threshold and speech understanding are on average quite predictable at least for persons with normal hearing e g French and Steinberg 1947 American National Standards Institute 1997 When the background noise contains speech however perceptual or informational masking may occur in addition to energetic masking Carhart et al 1969 Carhart et al 1975 Hawley et al 1999 2004 Brungart 2001a Brungart et al 2001 Arbogast et al 2002 2005 Carhart and colleagues 1969 used the term perceptual masking to refer to the additional masking observed when the masker consisted of actual talkers compared to modulated noise More recently the term informational masking which was originally used to describe results from certain types of masking experiments with nonspeech stimuli has been used to describe this effect e g Hawley et al 1999 Brungart 2001a Arbogast et al 2005 A precise definition of informational masking is currently a matter of debate In general however informational masking may be described as masking that is not energetic in nature thus implying more central masking effects e g Durlach et al 2003 Informational masking may occur with nonspeech signals when there are high levels of uncertainty regarding the target stimulus or masker Watson et al 1976 Lutfi 1989 Informational masking may also occur with speech signals particularly when the background competition is also speech In cases where informational masking occurs both the target speech and competition are audible to the listener yet the listener has difficulty separating the target and competition due to similarities in their temporal and or semantic structure Brungart 2001a Brungart et al 2001 Although energetic masking may exist in 433 Journal of the American Academy of Audiology Volume 17 Number 6 2006 these types of situations it does not appear to be the only factor limiting speech understanding given that by definition both the target and masking speech are intelligible Under some experimental conditions informational masking effects in speech tasks have been shown to be quite large Brungart and colleagues Brungart 2001a Brungart et al 2001 estimated informational masking effects in persons with normal hearing using the Coordinate Response Measure test CRM Bolia et al 2000 Brungart 2001b The CRM is a speech recognition test in which the target and masker sentences have the same semantic and syntactic structure making them highly confusable and therefore useful in exploring informational masking effects In one experiment Brungart et al 2001 compared speech understanding using CRM sentences as maskers high informational masking condition to speech understanding when listening to a primarily energetic modulated noise masker with the same longterm spectral shape and the long term temporal envelope of the CRM speech maskers When four maskers were used the authors reported an approximate 80 decrease in monaural speech understanding Specifically the performance of persons with normal hearing was evaluated in the presence of a four talker speech masker and a noise modulated with the envelope of a four talker speech masker Brungart et al 2001 In this example however the decrease in speech recognition was due to a combination of energetic and informational masking as is the case when any broadband stimulus is used as both the target and masker In addition because potential differences in the energetic masking properties of the speech and noise maskers exist it is difficult to parse out the magnitude of the informational and energetic masking effects on these results In a series of well controlled studies Arbogast et al 2002 2005 attempted to isolate the effects of informational and energetic maskers by creating sinewave speech targets and maskers Sinewave speech is created by modulating pure tones of a given frequency with the amplitude envelope of actual speech filtered at that center frequency In one condition the masker consisted of sinewave speech with frequency components that were in disparate frequency bands than those for the sinewave target speech thus minimizing energetic masking effects In this condition an additional 22 dB of masking was observed in participants with normal hearing compared to that seen with a primarily energetic masker Although informational masking effects can be quite large in some laboratory conditions the magnitude of informational masking that occurs in everyday speech environments is unclear Several factors that are common in everyday speech environments are known to reduce informational masking such as knowledge of the target speaker reduced uncertainty spatial separation of the target and masking speech and differences in vocal characteristics between the target and masking speech e g Hawley et al 1999 2004 Brungart 2001a Noble and Perrett 2002 Arbogast et al 2002 2005 In addition there is substantial research suggesting that it is the relationship between the amplitude spectrum of the speech and masker i e the signal to noise ratio or SNR that dictates speech understanding in many noise backgrounds not the similarity in semantic and temporal structure of conversational speech and background talkers French and Stienberg 1947 Miller 1947 Dirks and Bower 1969 American National Standards Institute 1997 Thus it is possible that informational masking in everyday environments plays only a small role in the speech understanding difficulties of persons with hearing loss There has been relatively little work exploring the interaction between hearing loss and informational masking Kidd et al 2002 using nonspeech stimuli suggested that hearing loss may limit the ability to perceptually segregate components of complex sounds This is a potentially important factor in our ability to understand speech in a background noise containing speech and suggests that the presence of hearing loss may increase susceptibility to informational masking In contrast some recent work suggests that informational masking effects are either relatively unaffected or actually reduced by the presence of hearing loss Micheyl et al 2000 Alexander and Lutfi 2004 Arbogast et al 2005 Alexander and Lutfi 2004 using nonspeech stimuli reported less informational masking in persons with hearing loss They measured thresholds for a 2000 Hz pure tone in the 434 Hearing Loss Hearing Aids and Informational Masking Hornsby et al presence of a masker designed to produce varying amounts of informational masking while limiting energetic masking When tested at equal sound pressure levels SPLs the authors found the participants with hearing impairment HI showed significantly less informational masking than the participants with normal hearing NH In contrast when SPLs were reduced for the NH group and they were retested at sensation levels SLs comparable to the HI group informational masking effects were quite similar The authors suggest that masker variance and hence uncertainty is reduced at the lower SL experienced by the HI participants resulting in reduced informational masking Arbogast and colleagues 2005 also reported less informational masking in persons with hearing loss compared to an age matched control group with normal hearing These differences were reduced when differences in SL between the normal hearing and hearing impaired groups were taken into account The influence of SL on informational masking has implications in terms of amplification for persons with hearing loss Recent results suggesting that in some conditions informational masking actually increases as SL increases Alexander and Lutfi 2004 Arbogast et al 2005 implies that the use of hearing aids could actually increase informational masking effects It is not clear whether the benefits of increased audibility through the use of hearing aids would offset any potential increase in informational masking Current rehabilitation methods often focus on methods to reduce energetic masking effects i e FM systems directional microphones Understanding the benefits and limitations of hearing aids in the presence of informational maskers however may be necessary to optimize rehabilitation strategies and speech understanding If traditional amplification strategies are not effective alternative schemes may need to be developed or minimally counseling strategies will need to incorporate this limitation The primary purpose of the current study was to estimate the effects of informational masking present in everyday conversational settings on the speech understanding of persons with and without hearing loss We were also interested in the benefits and limitations of amplification in settings containing both informational and energetic masker components PROCEDURES Participants Two groups of adults participated in this study One group consisted of a control group of 15 participants

hearing losses included in this study is shown by dashed lines 435 Journal of the American Academy of Audiology Volume 17 Number 6 2006 Participants with hearing loss ranged in age from Test Setting A 3 2 meter square 2 meters high sound treated room modified with reflective panels served as the test environment Frequency specific reverberation times Rt60 time required for 60 dB decay after signal

from the software fitting screen varied with frequency and ranged from Speech and Masking Stimuli Speech understanding in noise was assessed using a modified version of the Hearing in Noise Test HINT Nilsson et al 1994 The modifications to the HINT procedure were all related to the presentation and type of competing noise used as described below The HINT is an adaptive procedure used to determine the SNR necessary to achieve 50 correct sentence recognition Using this test the sentence level is adaptively varied in the presence of a constant level background noise to determine threshold Each experimental condition was evaluated using two ten sentence lists Experimental condition and list order were randomly assigned to each participant using a latin square design In addition for the HI participants the aided unaided presentation order was counterbalanced Speech materials were presented through a single loudspeaker Tannoy System 600 at a Hearing Aids The BTE version of the Phonak ClaroTM was used as the test instrument in the aided conditions This is a digital 20 channel lowthreshold fast acting compression aid The devices were fit bilaterally in omnidirectional mode using the manufacturer s fast acting digital perception processing fast acting DPPTM compression algorithm Digital noise reduction known as fine scale noise cancellation was disabled for all testing Work by Moore and colleagues 1999 suggests that multichannel fast acting compression may provide optimal benefit for the types of maskers used in this study e g provide maximum gain in the temporal dips of the maskers Participants with hearing loss were fit bilaterally using custom made full shell earmolds with venting appropriate for the degree and configuration of hearing loss Hearing aid fittings

research has shown that the magnitude of informational masking produced by speech maskers varies with the number of maskers with the largest effects seen in the presence of a minimal number of maskers e g Carhart et al 1975 Brungart et al 2001 Therefore speech understanding was measured in three masker configurations two four and seven maskers to provide an estimate of the magnitude of informational masking across a range of everyday situations In each masker configuration speech understanding was assessed using two types of maskers that varied in the amount of informational masking they were expected to produce for a total of six speech and masker conditions The maskers consisted of male talkers reading on a specific topic more informational masking and speech shaped modulated noises less informational masking Given that a primary goal of the study was to provide an estimate of the magnitude of informational masking in everyday speech environments each masker was presented from a separate loudspeaker that was spatially separated from the target speech which was located at a was equated prior to adjusting the overall level of the combined maskers to 65 dBA Calibration prior to each test session was performed to assure an overall level of 65 dBA Figure 2 Panels A B and C show the masker configurations for the two four and seven masker conditions used in this study Speech and noise loudspeaker locations are shown by the open square and filled triangles respectively 437 Journal of the American Academy of Audiology Volume 17 Number 6 2006 Derivation of Masker Materials The maskers used in this study included individual talkers and speech shaped noises modulated by the envelope of the individual talkers Each loudspeaker presented a different talker or talker matched noise from a separate spatial location Masker configurations using individual talkers as maskers consisted of two four or seven loudspeakers each outputting a single male talker reading test passages from the Connected Speech Test CST Cox et al 1987 1988 Each CST passage consists of approximately ten sentences describing a specific topic e g lemons The passages were derived from a children s educational reading source see Cox et al 1987 for details The CST passages were chosen as masking materials because they provide a contextually rich dialogue rather than single unrelated sentences that may result in informational masking more consistent with that present in everyday communication settings Male talkers were used in an attempt to create masking conditions that were both realistic yet highlighted informational masking effects Specifically the HINT test materials are also spoken by a male talker and informational masking is higher when the target speaker and maskers are of the same sex Brungart 2001a Brungart et al 2001 At the same time realistic environments exist in which the target and masking speech are predominately of a single sex Recordings of the individual talkers reading the CST passages were made in an anechoic chamber and stored on a computer hard disk All talkers were native speakers of American English Offline digital filtering using the FIR2 function and a 1000th order FIR filter implemented in MatlabTM was used to match the long term rms spectra of each CST passage recorded by each talker to that of the long term rms spectra of the HINT materials The modulated noise maskers used in this study were derived from uncorrelated segments of Gaussian noise that were first spectrally shaped using the FIR2 function and a 1000th order FIR filter implemented in MatlabTM to match the long term rms spectrum of the HINT materials The shaped noises were then modulated using the envelopes of the same single talkers reading the CST passages The envelopes of the single talker maskers were derived in MatlabTM by implementing half wave rectification of a given single talker passage followed by low pass filtering of the halfwave rectified signal using a sixth order butterworth filter with a 30 Hz low pass cutoff frequency The envelope was then applied to the shaped noise providing a primarily energetic masker that retained the long term spectral and temporal patterns of the single talker maskers The long term spectrum of all individual talker and modulated noise maskers closely approximated the long term spectrum of the HINT sentences The mean error across 1 3octave bands from 160 to 8000 Hz between individual talkers modulated noises and the HINT spectrum was 0 19 and 0 22 dB respectively with standard deviations less than 1 dB The maximum error in a given 1 3octave band for any individual talker or modulated noise was 3 dB RESULTS Effects of Masker Type NormalHearing Participants The current study examined the effects of type and number of maskers on speech understanding of persons with and without hearing loss The performance of the NH control group was examined first using a two factor repeated measures ANOVA The within subjects independent variables were masker type speech or noise and number of maskers two four or seven the dependent variable was the HINT score in each masker condition A 0 05 level of significance was used in all analyses described here Summary results of the primary analyses are shown in Table 2 The results from the two factor ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of number of maskers two four and seven but not type of masker SM and NM In addition a significant interaction between type and number of maskers was observed Followup analyses were conducted using a series of single factor ANOVAs that compared HINT thresholds in speech and noise maskers separately in the two four and sevenmasker configurations Results in the sevenmasker configuration revealed significantly

speech and noise maskers was observed in the four masker configuration These results suggest that spatially separated individual talkers similar to everyday settings do cause some informational masking However the relative effect of the informational masking components of our masking speech varied based on the number of maskers being most apparent in the sevenmasker configuration Figure 3 shows HINT thresholds for the NH participants in the two four and seven masker speech SM and noise NM configurations Effects of Hearing Loss on Speech Recognition in the Presence of Speech and Noise Maskers Following this initial analysis differences in the effects of masker type speech versus speech modulated noise in the NH and HI participants were compared We were interested in whether the pattern of performance in the various masker conditions differed from that of the NH group For comparative purposes HINT thresholds for the NH unaided HI and aided HI participants are shown together in Figure 4 Using a series of three factor mixedmodel ANOVAs NH performance was compared to HI performance separately in the unaided and aided conditions The between Figure 3 Thresholds for 50

Academy of Audiology Volume 17 Number 6 2006 subjects independent variable was group NH and HI unaided or HI aided and the withinsubjects independent variables were masker type and number of maskers The dependent variable was the HINT score in each masker condition An analysis of NH and unaided HI performance revealed significant main effects of group HI and NH type of masker SM and NM and number of maskers two four or seven As expected and as seen in Figure 4 performance was poorer for the unaided HI group across all test conditions In addition averaged across groups performance was poorer as the number of maskers increased and performance was significantly poorer although the difference was small when speech was used as a masker compared to the speech modulated noise maskers In addition significant two way interactions were observed Consistent with past research a significant interaction between number of maskers and group was observed Averaged across masker types performance for the NH group systematically improved as the number of maskers decreased while no such release from masking was observed for the HI participants Additionally a significant interaction between type and number of maskers was observed with patterns consistent with those described in the NH analysis That is in the sevenmasker configuration performance averaged across groups was poorer when the maskers were speech than when they were speechmodulated noises In contrast in the twomasker configuration performance was better when the maskers were speech Finally no significant two way interaction between group and type of masker or three way interaction was observed The lack of a significant interaction between group and masker type suggests that the masking effects of our speech and speech modulated noise were similar for the NH and unaided HI participants in this study Summary results of the ANOVA analyses on the NH and unaided HI participants are shown in Table 3 Figure 4 Thresholds for 50

Aided Speech Recognition Performance in the Presence of Speech and Noise Maskers Another focus of this study was on the benefits and limitations of hearing aids in the presence of informational maskers One way to examine this question is to compare the performance of aided HI participants to the gold standard provided by the NH control group Specifically we can ask whether hearing aids restore speech understanding in noise for HI persons to levels comparable to NH individuals when the background noise contains an informational masking component To compare NH and aided HI performance a three factor mixed model ANOVA was performed on the NH and aided HI participants HINT thresholds Summary results of the ANOVA analysis are shown in Table 4 Average HINT thresholds from these conditions are shown in Figure 4 and clearly show that performance of the aided HI participants remains substantially poorer than the NH control group The results of the statistical analysis as seen by the significant effect of group confirmed that overall aided HI performance remained significantly poorer than that of the NH control group Consistent with the comparison of NH and unaided HI performance a significant interaction between number of maskers and group was observed i e HI performance does not improve as the number of maskers is decreased In contrast to the unaided comparison however a significant two way interaction between type of masker and group and a significant three way interaction between type number of maskers and group was also observed Follow up analyses showed that in contrast to NH performance aided HI performance was consistently poorer in the presence of the speech maskers compared to the noise maskers regardless of the number of maskers presented Recall that for the NH participants performance in the two masker condition was significantly better in the presence of the speech masker Effect of Hearing Aids on Informational Masking Aided Benefit Although the results from the previous analysis revealed that hearing aids did not restore speech understanding to normal it is of interest to examine the benefit that hearing aids did provide to our study participants To Table 3 Results from Mixed Model NH vs unaided HI ANOVA Effect Type Num_masker Group Type x group Num_masker x group Type x num_masker Type x num_masker x group NH vs Unaided HI

ANOVA was performed on the HI unaided and aided HINT scores As expected a significant main effect of aid condition was observed with performance improving in the aided condition Also consistent with the previous analyses a significant main effect of masker type was observed with performance being poorer in the speech masker conditions Of primary interest however was the significant interaction between aid condition and type of masker Averaged across number of maskers persons with hearing loss received less benefit from hearing aids in the presence of the more informational masker the speech maskers than the speech modulated noise primarily energetic maskers Summary results of the ANOVA analysis are shown in Table 5 To determine the source of this significant interaction a series of two factor ANOVAs examining unaided and aided performance in the speech and noise maskers were performed These analyses showed a significant main effect of aid condition only in the presence of the speech modulated noise with performance being significantly better in the aided condition Follow up testing comparing unaided and aided performance in the speech modulated noise in the two four and seven masker configurations revealed significantly better aided performance in the four and two masker conditions Aided performance in the sevenmasker condition followed a similar pattern but the benefit was not statistically significant A similar but not statistically significant pattern was observed in the speech masker conditions In other words on average hearing aids did not significantly improve speech understanding compared to unaided performance when listening in the presence of speech maskers Figure 5 shows aided benefit i e the difference between unaided and aided HINT thresholds in dB for both noise types as a function of number of maskers Quantifying Informational Masking Effects A primary focus of this study was to estimate the effects of informational masking present in everyday conversational settings on persons with and without hearing loss Informational masking was functionally defined as the additional masking observed in the presence of speech maskers which contain both energetic and informational masking components compared to that observed for a speech modulated noise which is primarily an energetic masker We can use the analyses described above to identify the situations in which significant informational masking occurred Informational masking effects the difference in HINT thresholds measured in speech and speech modulated noise maskers for the NH unaided HI and aided HI groups as a function of number of maskers are shown in Figure 6 The stars identify the specific conditions where significant informational masking occurred When plotted in this fashion informational masking effects appear present and similar in magnitude across groups in the seven masker configuration In addition the pattern of informational masking effects appears similar for the NH and unaided HI in that informational masking appears to increase as the number of maskers increases In contrast the magnitude of informational masking remains relatively constant as the number of maskers increases for the aided HI group Table 5 Results from the Three Factor Repeated Measures HI unaided vs aided ANOVAs Unaided vs Aided HI Aid condition Type Num_masker Aid condition x Type Aid

masker conditions 443 Journal of the American Academy of Audiology Volume 17 Number 6 2006 DISCUSSION T he current study explored the magnitude of informational masking effects present in everyday environments when the background noise consists of conversational speech maskers We were interested specifically in how these effects would vary with the presence of hearing loss and whether hearing aids would be useful in limiting the negative effects of informational masking in everyday conversational speech settings However several factors discussed below may influence our estimate of informational masking effects and its interactions with hearing loss and hearing aids Energetic Masking Effects One issue in estimating the magnitude of informational masking when using broadband signals and maskers as was done in this study is that energetic masking is also occurring When using speech as both the target and masker disentangling the contribution of the informational and energetic masking components is not a trivial task In the current study our estimates of informational masking are confounded to some degree by differences in energetic masking between our two masker types i e speech and speech modulated noise Although the noise maskers matched the long term spectral and temporal properties of the speech maskers the short term spectral and temporal properties of the speech and noise were not matched Real speech contains rapid amplitude fluctuations that vary in a frequency dependent fashion These rapid spectro temporal fluctuations are not present in the speech modulated noise only the longterm changes in the envelope are matched It is likely that any given speech masker contained more spectro temporal dips than its matched speech modulated noise masker and thus provided less energetic masking at some instances than the modulated noise This potential difference in the energetic masking properties of the speech and noise maskers is likely the cause of the better performance seen in the NH participants in the two talker speech masker configuration compared to the two speech modulated noise maskers see Figures 4 and 6 In the twotalker configuration relatively large differences in the short term spectro temporal properties of the speech and noise maskers may exist and the NH participants are able to take advantage of these to listen in the dips As additional talkers are added differences in the temporal properties of the individual speakers fill in the dips making the long and short term spectrum of the speech and noise maskers more comparable and more steady state compared to the situation where only two talkers are used Despite differences in the energetic masking properties of the speech and noise maskers these study results support the idea that everyday speech can cause both informational and energetic masking This is supported by the fact that as additional maskers were added essentially reducing the differences in spectro temporal fluctuations between masker types the speech maskers became more effective than the noise maskers see Figure 6 If differences in performance when using the speech and noise maskers were due solely to differences in energetic masking we would expect the noise maskers to continue to remain more effective than the speech maskers even as the numbers of maskers increased from two to seven Figures 4 and 6 show that at least for the NH and unaided HI groups the speech maskers become more effective than the noise maskers as the number of maskers increases suggesting factors other than energetic masking are impacting the results Figure 6 shows that the relative effect of informational masking resulting from conversational speech can be large in some conditions A maximum informational masking effect 2 5 dB change in SNR required to achieve 50 correct sentence recognition was observed in the aided HI group when using four maskers This change in SNR corresponds to a change in percent correct score that will vary based on the specific test material Assuming a transfer function slope of 12 dB a change in SNR of 444 Hearing Loss Hearing Aids and Informational Masking Hornsby et al test materials designed to highlight informational masking effects such as the CRM Effects of Age and Hearing Loss and Sensation Level on Informational Masking Our study results showed that informational masking effects were similar between persons without hearing loss and unaided persons with hearing loss at least when differences in the energetic masking properties of the masking stimuli are small e g in the seven masker configuration see Figure 6 This is in contrast to some recent work suggesting that informational masking effects may be smaller in persons with hearing loss at least when tested at comparable SPLs Alexander and Lutfi 2004 Arbogast et al 2005 Several factors however make it difficult to draw conclusions based on the current study about the effects of hearing loss per se on informational masking As mentioned previously the use of more realistic test settings and speech stimuli while providing face validity results in settings where informational masking effects are reduced Thus the fact that informational masking effects were similar between groups in the current study may be due to the fact that in real world settings informational masking effects are small compared to energetic masking effects which were larger in the HI and likely dominate performance In addition previous work has shown that masker SL affects the amount of informational masking in a given test situation Alexander and Lutfi 2004 Arbogast et al 2005 Given that in the current study masker levels were fixed at 65 dB SPL for both the NH and HI groups resulting in lower masker SLs for the HI participants we might expect less informational masking for the HI participants in this study In addition to the experimental configuration limiting informational masking e g using spatially separated maskers age differences between our NH and HI groups may have also played a role in our findings Unfortunately in the current study the age range of our HI participants is quite narrow and substantially different than that of the NH group This coupled with the fact that substantial differences in hearing thresholds exist between our groups makes disentangling the effects of age from hearing loss quite difficult We can however speculate on the potential impact Although recent work by Li et al 2004 found no differences in the negative effects of speech distracters on young adults with normal hearing and older adults the older adults had only mild high frequency hearing loss the ages of their older adults ranged from 63 to 75 years In contrast nine of the 15 HI participants in the current study were over the age of 75 with five between the ages of Benefits and Limitations of Hearing Aids on Informational Masking A primary result from this study regarding hearing aids and informational masking is that omnidirectional hearing aids were relatively ineffective in improving 445 Journal of the American Academy of Audiology Volume 17 Number 6 2006 speech understanding when the masking noises were spatially separated from the speech and contained both energetic and informational masking components i e speech masker conditions The poorer thannormal performance of the aided HI group regardless of masker condition is consistent with decades of past research showing a similar result e g Plomp 1986 Even when aided substantial research has shown that HI performance in noise particularly modulated background noises is consistently poorer than performance of a NH control group e g Bronkhorst and Plomp 1992 These study results show that the decrement experienced by our HI participants was largest when the noise contained informational as well as energetic masking components at least in the four and sevenmasker conditions see Figure 6 In addition the use of hearing aids in the higher informational masking conditions speech maskers did not significantly improve speech understanding over the unaided condition for the HI participants Hearing aids provided only limited benefit 1 1 dB averaged across the three masker configurations in the presence of the speech maskers see Figure 5 As discussed earlier this may be related in part to the age of our participants and the higher masker SLs experienced in the aided conditions Regardless hearing aids are designed primarily to restore audibility and are thus not expected to heavily impact the central factors e g stimulus masker uncertainty similarity that appear to be largely responsible for informational masking effects that occur in speech settings Thus the finding of limited benefit of hearing aids in the presence of informational maskers is not surprising This does however highlight the limitations of omnidirectional hearing aids in real world noisy environments particularly those that contain speech signals as the primary masker Given these limitations there is a clear need for additional research investigating the utility of additional technological e g directional microphones FM systems and counseling strategies such as reducing background noises improving lighting and access to visual cues etc that may help reduce these deficits SUMMARY T he results from the current study suggest the following 1 Speech maskers presented from discrete spatial locations in most configurations result in additional masking compared to a primarily energetic masker speech modulated noise This finding supports the idea that background noise consisting of multiple spatially separated talkers as occurs in everyday environments results in both informational and energetic masking 2 The relative effect of informational masking resulting from spatially separated talkers varies based on the number of talkers When the number of talkers is small e g two the informational masking component of everyday conversational speech may be obscured by energetic masking effects As the number of talkers increases from two to seven both informational and energetic masking effects can be observed 3 Informational masking effects due to spatially separated talkers appear to be similar for older adults with hearing loss in the unaided condition and younger adults without hearing loss 4 When the masking noise contains both energetic and informational masking components increasing audibility via the use of omnidirectional microphone hearing aids results in only limited improvements in speech understanding REFERENCES Alexander JM Lutfi RA 2004 Informational masking in hearing impaired and normal hearing listeners sensation level and decision
