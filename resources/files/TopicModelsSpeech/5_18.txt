Rawalpindi 46000 Pakistan javed ashraf khattakn mcs edu pk naveedrao gmail com athar mcs nust edu pk Abstract Automatic Speech Recognition ASR is one of the advanced fields of Natural Language Processing NLP Recent past has witnessed valuable research activities in ASR in English European and East Asian languages But unfortunately South Asian Languages in general and Urdu in particular have received very less attention In this paper we present an approach to develop an ASR system for Urdu language The proposed system is based on an open source speech recognition framework called Sphinx4 which uses statistical based approach HMM Hidden Markov Model for developing ASR system We present a Speaker Independent ASR system for small sized vocabulary i e fifty two isolated most spoken Urdu words and suggest that this research work will form the basis to develop medium and large size vocabulary Urdu speech recognition system Keywords Speech recognition Urdu language Hidden Markov Model CMU Sphinx4 1 Introduction There are between 60 and 80 million native speakers of standard Urdu Khari Boli According to the SIL Ethnologue 1999 data Hindi Urdu is the fifth most spoken language in the world 13 According to George Weber s article Top Languages The World s 10 Most Influential Languages in Language Today Hindi Urdu is the fourth most spoken language in the world with 4 7 percent of the world s population after Mandarin English and Spanish 1 Despite a large number of populations speaking Urdu very little research work has been done related to ASR for Urdu language Most of the previous work related to SR for Urdu language is restricted to digits only using ANN However modern generalpurpose speech recognition systems are generally based on Hidden Markov Models HMMs This research work focuses on recognition of Urdu words using HMMs 2 Related Work Centre for Research in Urdu Language Processing CRULP Lahore Pakistan 2 and National Language Authority NLA Islamabad Pakistan 3 are the most prominent C J Hopfe et al Eds NLDB 2010 LNCS 6177 pp Speaker Independent Urdu Speech Recognition Using HMM 141 names among those who are doing dedicated research in NLP for Urdu Language CRULP and NLA have done research in many areas of Urdu Language Processing However not much published research work is available related to ASR for Urdu language M U Akram and M Arif 4 try to analyse and implement Pattern Matching and Acoustic Modelling approaches to SR for Urdu language They propose an Urdu SR system using the later approach They have used ANN to classify a set of frames into phonetic based categories at each frame To search the best sequence path for the given word to be recognised they used Viterbi search algorithm S M Azam et al 5 use ANN to propose SR system for Urdu They have developed SR system for isolated Urdu digits only Moreover the proposed system works only for one speaker Abdul Ahad et al 6 also use ANN using Multilayer Perceptron MLP Again they propose a system for Urdu digits for mono speaker database only S K Hasnain et al 7 also use ANN to implement their proposed system They suggest feed forward ANN model implemented using Matlab and Simulink Again the model is developed only for isolated Urdu digits 3 HMM Based Speech Recognition Traditional SR software falls into one of three categories 8 These categories are Template based approaches Knowledge based approaches and Statistical based approaches Template based approaches compare speech against a set of pre recorded words Knowledge based approaches involve the hard coding of known variations of speech into a system Both of these methods become impractical for a larger number of words Finally in Statistical based approaches e g HMM variations in speech are modelled statistically using automatic learning procedures This approach represents the current state of SR and is the most widely used technique today HMM are statistical models which output a sequence of symbols or quantities Speech signal could be viewed as a piecewise stationary signal or a short time stationary signal That is one could assume in a short time in the range of 10 milliseconds speech could be approximated as a stationary process Speech could thus be thought of as a Markov model for many stochastic processes 9 HMM can be trained automatically and are simple and computationally feasible to use In speech recognition the HMM would output a sequence of n dimensional realvalued vectors with n being a small integer such as 10 outputting one of these every 10 milliseconds The vectors would consist of cepstral coefficients which are obtained by taking a Fourier transform of a short time window of speech and decorrelating the spectrum using a cosine transform then taking the first most significant coefficients The HMM will tend to have in each state a statistical distribution that is a mixture of diagonal covariance Gaussians which will give a likelihood for each observed vector Each word or for more general SR systems each phoneme will have a different output distribution a HMM for a sequence of words or phonemes is made by concatenating the individual trained HMMs for the separate words and phonemes 9 142 J Ashraf et al We propose an Urdu ASR system using open source SR framework called Carnegie Mellon University CMU Sphinx4 which is also based on HMM Sphinx has never been used to develop Urdu ASR system This research work will open new doors for researchers of Urdu ASR systems 3 1 CMU Sphinx4 Framework Sphinx 4 is a state of the art speech recognition system written entirely in the Java programming language It was created via a joint collaboration between the Sphinx group at CMU Sun Microsystems Laboratories Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs MERL and Hewlett Packard HP with contributions from the University of California at Santa Cruz UCSC and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT 10 11 3 2 Sphinx4 Architecture The Sphinx 4 architecture has been designed with a high degree of modularity There are three main blocks in the design the frontend the decoder and the knowledge base KB These are controllable by an external application The Frontend module takes in speech and parameterizes it into a sequence of output features The KB or Linguist provides the information the decoder needs to do its job It is made up of three modules Acoustic Model Dictionary and Language Model Acoustic Model contains a representation often statistical of a sound created by training using acoustic data Dictionary has the pronunciation of all the words to be recognised Language Model contains a representation often statistical of the probability of occurrence of words The decoder is the main block of Sphinx 4 and performs the actual recognition It comprises a graph construction module which translates any type of standard language model provided to the KB by the application into an internal format and together with information from the dictionary and structural information from one or more sets of acoustic models constructs a Language HMM The latter is then used by the search module to determine the most likely sequence of words that could be represented by a series of features 12 13 3 3 SphinxTrain SphinxTrain is the acoustic training toolkit for CMU Sphinx versions 1 2 3 and 4 It is a suite of programs scripts and documentation for building acoustic models from speech data for the Sphinx recognisers 17 4 Urdu Words Recognition Application 4 1 Brief Overview of Urdu Language Urdu is written right to left in an extension of the Persian alphabet which is itself an extension of the Arabic alphabet Urdu uses characters from the extended Arabic character set used for Persian It further extends this set to represent sounds which are present in Urdu but not it Arabic or Persian including aspirated stop and alveolar Speaker Independent Urdu Speech Recognition Using HMM 143 consonants and long vowels 14 Altogether there are 58 letters in Urdu given in Figure 1 15 other sources may give slightly different set Fig 1 Urdu Character Set 4 2 Roman Urdu Urdu is occasionally also written in the Roman script Roman Urdu is the name used for the Urdu language written with the Roman alphabet Roman Urdu has been used since the days of the British Raj partly as a result of the availability and low cost of Roman movable type for printing presses The use of Roman Urdu was common in contexts such as product labels Today it is regaining popularity among users of textmessaging and Internet services and is developing its own style and conventions We have used Roman Urdu script for this research work However bare transliterations of Urdu into Roman letters omit many phonemic elements that have no equivalent in English or other languages commonly written in the Latin alphabet such as or 16 4 3 System Components The system components are shown in figure 2 below Fig 2 System Components 144 J Ashraf et al 4 3 1 Dictionary Lexicon The Lexicon development process consists of defining a phonetic set and generating the word pronunciation for training acoustic and language models Our dictionary contains fifty two most commonly used spoken Urdu words including ten Urdu digits 0 to 9 The pronunciations of each word are shown in Table 1 4 3 2 Acoustic Model Acoustic Model contains a representation of a sound created by training using acoustic data Sphinx 4 uses models created with SphinxTrain Two main acoustic models that are used by Sphinx 4 TIDIGITS and Wall Street Journal WSJ are already included in the lib directory of Sphinx 4 binary distribution These acoustic models are also used for other Latin languages such as French or Italian due to similarities between these languages and English language from phoneme point of view However as mentioned before there are great differences between English and Urdu language We also tried to use English acoustic model provided with Sphinx4 libraries to recognise Urdu words but as expected the results were very poor WER obtained was about 60 Developing speech corpus or acoustic model is not a trivial task and requires resources to be allocated Unfortunately such resources were not available for this research For this research we managed to get recording of ten samples of each utterance from ten different persons The speech recording and breaking each sample of fifty two words into one word file was very time consuming process Table 1 Urdu Words with their pronunciation Speaker Independent Urdu Speech Recognition Using HMM 145 Feature Extraction For every recording in the training corpus a set of feature files was computed from the speech training data Each utterance of a word was transformed into a sequence of feature vectors using the front end executables provided with Sphinx 4 training package The detailed process can be found from 10 and 12 The training was performed using 5200 utterances of speech data from 10 different speakers 52 words x10 samples 520 utterances by each speaker Transcription File Each recording is accurately transcribed any error in the transcription will mislead the training process later This process is done manually i e we listen to the recordings then we match exactly what we hear into text Even the silence and the noise should also be represented in the transcription file 18 4 3 3 Language Model Sphinx 4 supports three types of language models The Context Free Grammar CGF is usually used in speech applications based on command and control The n gram grammars are used for free speech form The simplest type of language model is called wordlist grammar in which instead of breaking a word into sub units or phonemes complete word is taken as one phoneme For example Chaar English four is taken as one phoneme The wordlist grammar is recommended for isolated word recognition Being an isolated Urdu words recognition application we have used wordlist grammar in our proposed system 5 Experimental Results 5 1 Experimental Setup We performed two types of experiments for evaluating the performance of our system First type of test involved evaluating the performance of the system using speakers involved in training Second type of test was carried out using speakers who were not involved in the training phase We observed the behaviour of the system for 1 2 4 8 and 16 Gaussian models 5 2 Evaluation Criteria The evaluation was made according to recognition accuracy and computed using Word Error Rate WER defined by the equation 1 below which aligns a recognised word string against the correct word string and compute the number of substitutions S deletions D and insertions I from the number of correct words N WER S D I N 100 1 WER of 10 means that there was an error substitution deletion or insertion of one word out of ten words spoken by a speaker 146 J Ashraf et al 5 3 Results We found that 8 Gaussian models produced the best results in both the tests Recognition results for first test are shown in table 2 Five different speakers who were also part of training phase participated in this test Each speaker was asked to utter at random twenty Urdu words thrice The results are shown for each speaker Table 2 Results for the first test of Urdu Words Recognition Application WER Test3 10 10 10 0 0 Mean Speaker Speaker1 Speaker2

participate in the training phase were involved in this test Again each speaker was asked to utter at random any twenty Urdu words thrice The results are shown for each speaker Note that the WER increased in this case because of new speakers Table 3 Results for the second test of Urdu Words Recognition Application WER Test2 Test3 10 10 10 20 0 10 10 10 10 10 Mean Speaker Speaker1 Speaker2 Speaker3 Speaker4 Speaker5 Test1 10 10 10 20 10 Mean WER 10 00 13 33 6 66 13 33 10 00 10 66 5 4 Findings of the Experiments There are very important findings that we would like to discuss here 1 Words with more distinct phones produced less accuracy in recognition 2 Words with similar type of phones were recognised interchangeably for example system got confused with words saat chaar and aath 3 We first experimented with recognition of ten digits only and then increased the vocabulary to fifty two words We found that Wordlist grammar is good for small size vocabulary however as we increased number of words the accuracy of recognition decreased Speaker Independent Urdu Speech Recognition Using HMM 147 4 As mentioned earlier transliterations of Urdu into Roman letters omit many phonemic elements that have no equivalent in English for example letter in word in word etc Transcription in Latin Urdu should increase the accuracy of recognition 6 Conclusions and Future Work In this research work we have developed first Urdu ASR system based on CMU Sphinx 4 The recognition results are much better as compared to Urdu ASR systems developed earlier We demonstrated that how Sphinx 4 framework can be used to build small to medium sized vocabulary Urdu ASR system The acoustic model for this ASR system is entirely developed by the authors of this work Since this research was first of its kind we kept it to isolated words recognition We identified the steps involved to develop such system This system can be used in applications where small vocabulary Urdu speech recognition is required Moreover this research work could form the basis for further research in Urdu ASR systems An immediate future work is to increase the vocabulary size to medium about 200 words Later on research can focus on developing Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recogniser LVCSR system for Urdu language We have already started our work on former We are also planning to continue our research to build LVCSR for Urdu language using Arabic also called Perso Arabic script phonemes instead of roman Urdu phonemes to cater for Urdu phonemes missing in the roman Urdu Acknowledgements This
