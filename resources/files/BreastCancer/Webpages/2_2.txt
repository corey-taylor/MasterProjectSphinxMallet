In 1995 following the publication of the NHMRC Guidelines for the Management of Early Breast Cancer an invitation was sent to potentially interested clinicians and other parties in the ACT and surrounding NSW to participate in the forming of a local interest group The intention was for the group to look at issues surrounding the management and treatment of breast cancer within the local environment In this section BCTG patient information Publications Breast Cancer Treatment Project A regional group The unique nature of the region was seen to be an important and distinctive feature a small number of hospitals and located within the ACT and the area covered by the Southern Area Health Service of NSW provided the potential to establish a regional group not aligned to any institution or area health service Map of treatment region This map covers the area where data is collected for the study Of all cases between 1997 and 2001 65 of new breast cancer cases are from the ACT and 35 from the South Eastern of NSW region The initial meetings of the group focused on developing the terms of reference and the local protocols for the various clinical groups Very early on in the life of the group it was agreed that if we were to make full use of the NHMRC guidelines then we would need to be able to monitor what treatment was being provided to women with breast cancer in the region and to compare that treatment with the best practice guidelines In order to do this appropriate data collection mechanisms needed to be put in place Funding was sought and gained from the Commonwealth for a project officer to undertake the development of a data base and the ongoing collection of data relating to the treatment of breast cancer Other activities the group has focused on include refining the data set and hearing from each clinical group in turn about new developments in breast cancer treatment A number of guest speakers have been invited to attend the meetings and to speak on national issues relating to breast cancer The meetings continue to be well attended 14 years after the establishment of the group and the wealth of data collected will provide an ongoing source of information to ensure that women receive the best care available
