Accidental results excite breast cancer researchers A drug that was originally developed in Newcastle to kill parasites in meat and livestock is instead proving to be a potent weapon against breast cancer See your ad here It has been four years since Dr Jennette Sakoff lab researcher at Calvery Mater Hospital embarked on a project with the intention that it would help agriculture She never imagined it would instead show all the signs of becoming a targeted killer of breast cancer cells completely ignoring the healthy breast tissue It failed miserably at killing the parasites Dr Sakoff said It is definitely a bit of serendipity they were never designed to target cancer We screen a lot of molecules in our research lab and that s when we noticed Today in Australia research has brought the five year survival rate for breast cancer to about 89per cent But on average seven women in the country died each day from the disease according to the Australian Institute of Health Welfare and Cancer Dr Sakoff part of the Hunter Medical Research Institute said the drug held new hope for those living with advanced or metastatic where the cancer reappears elsewhere breast cancer This may now actually offer an extra treatment particularly for advanced tumours that have spread Also if someone becomes resistant to treatment options it is that extra tool in the box Because the compounds were so selective in what they destroyed Dr Sakoff said the drug could also have fewer side effects Part of our drug discovery component is that some new molecules have been found to specifically kill breast cancer cell lines but do little to nothing in other tumour types Dr Sakoff said You get this nice selectivity that targets breast cancer cell lines We don t know how they are doing it at the moment it s an observation and we re trying work out how the molecules do it Its selectiveness is a good thing because you are likely to have fewer side effects It also shows that there is something selective and unique about breast cancer Dr Sakoff said research was currently up to the early animal testing stage and so far it had been tolerated well It s still in its very early stages of research she said But if everything goes to plan it has the potential to have huge significance Another HMRI researcher has been making huge progress in a study that looks at stopping breast cancer from spreading Dr Nikki Verrills from the University of Newcastle has been looking at how a certain gene is switched off in breast cancer We still don t know whether this the gene switching off is primary or secondary to cancer she said See your ad here The gene s normal role is to stop cells continuously dividing Dr Verrills said they were looking at whether turning the gene back on would be beneficial for those with metastatic breast cancer It seems to stop the movement of cells from one place to the other she said
