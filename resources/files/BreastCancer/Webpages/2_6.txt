Breast Cancer charity rejects US7000 donation raised by men motorboating their faces into women s breasts THREE men who raised US7000 7243 for breast cancer research by motorboating women s breasts say their donation was rejected because of haters Self styled pickup artists Jason Jesse and Kong run SimplePickup to teach men how to approach and ask out women They launched a fundraising effort earlier this month donating US20 to breast cancer research to each woman who let them shove their faces into their breasts They raised more than US2000 in one day and promised to chip in an extra US100 for every 100 000 views of the video on YouTube bringing the total to US7000 Do you love boobs We sure do And this month is breast cancer awareness month so today we re working to save some boobies they say in the video After seeing the video the charity asked them to take down the video refunded the money and asked the self proclaimed ladykillers not to use their name anymore It s obvious they had to do this because they were getting pressured by a small minority of haters who thought this video was offensive says Kong who says critics are completely out of line So congratulations haters breast cancer researchers literally just lost 7000 because of your personal problems with this video The trio are now soliciting ideas for what to do with that 7000 and suggest spending the money on another breast cancer charity or using the cash to commit random acts of kindness
