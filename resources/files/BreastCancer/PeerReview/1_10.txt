unavoidable epidemiologic realities The disease is common but only a small proportion of cases in the general population are attributable to inherited susceptibility Thus families may have multiple cases of breast cancer without inherited susceptibility and sporadic cases may occur even in families with inherited disease In addition the disease is not completely penetrant among susceptible persons with expression depending on gender age and nongenetic risk factors Finally both epidemiological and molecular evidence suggests heterogeneity We have tested simultaneously for genetic linkage and heterogeneity of breast cancer in families and our results suggest both the presence of a gene for early onset breast cancer on chromosome 17q21 and linkage heterogeneity of the disease Families and inheritance of susceptibility Our genetic analysis is based on 23 extended families with 146 cases of breast cancer Figs 1 and 2 All persons in our analysis are Caucasian and from a variety of original ancestries The 329 participating relatives now live in and were therefore sampled from 40 states of the United States Puerto Rico Canada the United Kingdom and Colombia H s UMAN DISEASE GENES

D17S74 alleles in this sample were estimated by selecting subjects from different families whose D17S74 fragments appearedto be of similar size on the basis of their familyblots and then analyzing the DNA from these unrelated persons in neighboring lanes on the same blots Some samples were included several times in order to identify distortions in the gels These population blots were analyzed without reference to sample numbers in order to determine which alleles could be consistently distinguished D17S74 had more than 30 distinguishable fragment lengths and hence more than 30 different alleles in our sample nine of which occurred more than once among unrelated individuals at frequencies ranging from 0 07 to 0 13 The other D17S74 alleles were only represented once in our sample but because extremely rare marker allele frequencies can have a major influence on estimates of lod scores and the T statistic 7 apparently unique alleles were each assigned the frequency 0 03 Results of linkage and heterogeneity analysis in the breast cancer families For the 23 families as a group homogeneity of linkage of breast cancer to D17S74 could be rejected at P equals 0 01 Multipoint analysisof linkage in the intervalD17S78 D17S41D17S74 D17S40 yielded likelihood ratios in favor of heterogeneity of linkage among the 23 families between 2000 1 and 1 4 x 106 to 1 After adjusting for heterogeneity among all families the maximum two point lod score is 3 28 at recombination distance of 0 014 from D17S74 with disease linked to this locus in 40 percent of the families Figs 1 and 2 Heterogeneity of linkage in these families appears explicable by age of disease onset Breast cancer is linked to markers in this chromosomal region specifically in families with early onset breast cancer Among the seven families with a mean age of breast cancer diagnosis less than or equal to 45 the two point lod score for linkage of D17S74 and breast cancer is 5 98 at a distance of 0 001 recombination units with a 95 percent confidence interval of 0 001 to 0 09 Table 1 In contrast total lod scores for the families with late onset disease are negative It is characteristicof linkage in the presence of heterogeneity that a modest lod score in this case 2 35 for all families ignoring heterogeneity at a fairly large recombination distance 0 20 recombination units masks two curves one with a more positive lod score in the linked families 5 98 at a smaller recombination fraction 0 001 to 0 09 and the other negative 15 Two point lod scores for all four markers in this chromosomal region suggest that a gene for susceptibility in the early onset families is likely to be within approximately 10 percent recombination of D1 7S74 Table 2 Multipoint analysis of the fourmarker interval yields a maximum lod score of 5 41 near D17S74 for the earliest onset families Table 2 Again total lod scores for families with older ages at diagnosis are negative throughout the interval Linkage of breast cancer to D17S74 was also evaluated on the basis of only the individuals with breast cancer in each family For this analysis all women without breast cancer and all men were assigned to the lowest risk group For the 23 families as a group the P value for homogeneity of linkage is 0 06 For the families with average age at diagnosis less than or equal to 45 the maximum lod score is 4 69 at close linkage with a 95 percent confidence interval for the recombination fraction of 0 001 to 0 10 Lod scores at close linkage to D17S74 are 2 19 for families 8 to 15 and 5 22 for families 16

pedigree member analysis of alleles shared by state among all individuals with breast cancer in each family also suggested linkage of early onset breast cancer to markersin this chromosomal region 16 These analyses defined families with early onset disease as those with an average age at breast cancer diagnosis of less than or equal to 45 However early onset could be defined in a variety of ways The cumulative lod scores for linkage of breast cancer to D1 7S74 as families with increasing age at disease onset are included in the analysis are indicated in Fig 3 and the right hand column of Table 1 Cumulative lod scores are above 5 0 for families with an average age at diagnosis of less than 48 remain positive for families with an average age at diagnosis of less than 52 and then drop sharply As specific alternative ways of defining early onset breast cancer we defined families with early onset disease to be those in which i most breast cancers in each family were diagnosed by age

the cases in the sample families 1 to 10 The critical results for all definitions were the same maximum lod scores for linkage of breast cancer to this chromosomal region are between 5 2 and 5 7 in the early onset families and negative in the late onset families and the disease gene appears to be within about 0 10 recombinatioi units of D17S74 Other risk factors for breast cancer in the families To determine whether the linked gene is expressed in the presence of any specific background of nongenetic risk factors for breast cancer we compared breast cancer risk factors for women in families

diagnosis Linkage analysis in families and loss of heterozygosity in tumors Comparisons of breast tumor tissue with normal tissue from the same individual have suggested that chromosomes lp 3p lip 13q 16q or 17p or some combination may harbor genes that are important for breast tumor progression 17 An earlier linkage analysisfrom our group based on fewer and less informative families suggested with a modest lod score that a gene for familial premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer is present on chromosome 16q 18 We have excluded the other regions suggested by loss of heterozygosity in tumors as locales of genes for inherited susceptibility to breast cancer 9 19 A gene or genes on chromosome 5q appear to be responsible for inherited forms of colon cancer and quite possibly for the initial somatic lesions of other colon cancers with genes on 12p K ras 17p p53 18q DCC and possibly elsewhere being responsible for subsequent invasion and metastasis 20 This pattern of multiple sequential events determined by alterations on more than one chromosome may also apply to breast cancer Negative lod scores in the families with late onset breast cancers may reflect any or all of the

analysis of linkage and heterogeneity Candidate genes on chromosome 17q The ultimate goal of gene mapping of human traits is to move from a known chromosomal location to identification of the crucial gene and characterization of its critical alterations This region of chromosome 17q includes several plausible candidate genes 21 A gene for a truncated form of the human epidermal growth factor receptor her2 MIM 164870 Mendelian Inheritance in Man is identical to erbb2or neu MIM 190150 The gene her2 acts as an oncogene in NIH 3T3 cells and is amplified in many primary breast tumors her2 amplification is associated with poor prognosis at least for nodepositive tumors 22 Other candidate genes in this region include that for estradiol 17P dehydrogenase edhbl7 MIM 264300 which is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of estrone to estradiol the homeobox 2 gene hox2 MIM 142960 which is criticalfor murine embryological development nm23 whose expression is associated with lymph node metastasis in primary breast carcinomas the gene for retinoic acid receptor ax rara MIM 180240 a protein that binds the possible anticarcinogen retinoic acid and wnt3 MIM 165330 one of the

1 4 and 9 and two women with thyroid cancer from families 5 and 13 were omitted entirely from the analysis In family 3 two women have breast and ovarian cancer and are defined as affected at the ages of their breast cancer diagnoses two other women died with ovarian cancer only and could not be included 6 J Ott Ann Hum Genet 47 311 1983 G M Lathrop J M Lalouel C Julier J Ott Am J Hum Genet 37 482

the difficulties in typing VNTR alleles is presented by family 18 in which allele K is alleged to appear in cousins without pedigree evidence for identity by descent in intervening relatives This assignment and others like it were made after analyzing several samples from the relatives on the same Southern blot genotyping them without reference to their sample numbers or positions in the pedigree and determining that the bands were indistinguishable among the four samples 15 L L Cavalli Sforza and M C King Am J Hum Genet 38 599 1985 16 For the 23 families as a whole the method of affected pedigree members yields a T value of 1 13 P 0 13 for the T statistic unadjusted for allele frequencies T equals 4 26 P 0 001 for the inverse square root weighting function and T equals 5 49 P 0 001 for the reciprocal weighting function The T statistic among the younger families was consistently significant with T values of 2 60 5 18 and 5 78 and empirical P values of 0 012 0 001 and 0 003 for the three weighting functions respectively 17 P Devilee et al Genomics 5 554 1989 M Genuardi H Tsihira D E Anderson G F Saunders Am J Hum Genet 45 73 1989 I U Ali R Lidereau C Theillet R Callahan
