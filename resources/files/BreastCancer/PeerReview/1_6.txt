Research Letters Results of the ATAC Arimidex Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination trial after completion of 5 years adjuvant treatment for breast cancer ATAC Trialists Group The standard adjuvant endocrine treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive localised breast cancer is 5 years of tamoxifen but recurrences and side effects restrict its usefulness The aromatase inhibitor anastrozole was compared with tamoxifen for 5 years in 9366 postmenopausal women with localised breast cancer After a median follow up of 68 months anastrozole signiﬁcantly prolonged disease free survival 575 events with anastrozole vs 651 with tamoxifen hazard ratio 0 87 95 CI 0 78 0 97 p 0 01 and time to recurrence 402 vs 498 0 79 0 70 0 90 p 0 0005 and signiﬁcantly reduced distant metastases 324 vs 375 0 86 0 74 0 99 p 0 04 and contralateral breast cancers 35 vs 59 42 reduction 12 62 p 0 01 Almost all patients have completed their scheduled treatment and fewer withdrawals occurred with anastrozole than with tamoxifen Anastrozole was also associated with fewer side effects than tamoxifen especially gynaecological problems and vascular events but arthralgia and fractures were increased Anastrozole should be the preferred initial treatment for postmenopausal women with localised hormone receptor positive breast cancer A All patients HR patients Favours anastrozole

trial compared 5 years of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole alone with tamoxifen alone or the combination as adjuvant therapy in 9366 postmenopausal women with localised breast cancer 2 3 Primary objectives were to discover whether anastrozole is at least as effective as tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with localised breast cancer and or offers beneﬁts in safety or tolerability over tamoxifen in this group of patients Initial analyses of the ATAC trial at 33 and 47 months of median follow up showed that anastrozole signiﬁcantly prolonged disease free survival and time to recurrence and reduced the incidence of contralateral breast cancer compared with tamoxifen 2 3 After these analyses the combination treatment arm was closed because of low efﬁcacy Details of the trial design methods primary objectives and endpoints have been reported previously 2 Here we compare the efﬁcacy and tolerability of anastrozole with that of tamoxifen after a median follow up of 68 months This time extends beyond the planned 5 year treatment period and only 8 of patients remain on trial treatment Treatment with anastrozole led to signiﬁcant improvements compared with tamoxifen

0 85 0 69 1 04 0 1 In favour of tamoxifen n 2229 for anastrozole 2236 for tamoxifen excluding patients with hysterectomy at baseline recorded at any time Patients with one or more fractures occurring at any time before recurrence includes patients no longer receiving treatment Patients may have had one or more fractures at different sites Table Prespeciﬁed adverse events on treatment or within 14 days of discontinuation recurrence is in addition to the 47 risk reduction previously shown for 5 years of tamoxifen versus placebo in adjuvant studies 4 No signiﬁcant differences were noted in effect according to subgroup at the 1 level and the hazard rate was lower for anastrozole in all subgroups except for patients who were hormonereceptor negative or whose hormone receptor status was unknown Absolute differences in recurrence rates increased over time even beyond 5 years of scheduled treatment suggesting that there is a carryover effect for anastrozole similar to that observed for tamoxifen 4 at least in the short term ﬁgure 1B The beneﬁts of anastrozole were seen at all times after the ﬁrst year of follow up In particular the high hazard rate seen in years 1 3 for tamoxifen was substantially suppressed by anastrozole We noted a signiﬁcant overall beneﬁt in time to distant recurrence for anastrozole 324 vs 375 events hazard ratio 0 86 95 CI 0 74 0 99 p 0 04 with a similar trend in the subset of hormone receptorpositive patients 0 84 0 70 1 00 p 0 06 The incidence of contralateral breast cancer was substantially reduced by anastrozole compared with tamoxifen all patients 35 vs 59 42 reduction 95 CI 12 62 p 0 01 hormone receptor positive patients 53 25 71 p 0 001 Since tamoxifen shows a 50 reduction in the occurrence of these tumours in hormone receptor positive patients compared with placebo 4 the ﬁndings from the ATAC study suggest that 2 anastrozole treatment might prevent 70 80 of hormone receptor positive tumours in women at high risk of breast cancer 831 women died 500 60 after recurrence of breast cancer and 331 40 without recurrence and due to other causes Overall survival was similar for anastrozole and tamoxifen hazard ratio 0 97 95 CI 0 85 1 12 p 0 7 a 12 reduction in deaths from breast cancer in the anastrozole group was not signiﬁcant 0 88 0 74 1 05 p 0 2 However since the trial population had a relatively good prognosis 5695 61 of patients were lymph node negative and 5959 64 had tumours 2 cm or smaller in diameter it is too early to expect a difference in survival For example it took at least 7 years to show a signiﬁcant survival advantage for tamoxifen versus placebo in previous adjuvant studies 5 The signiﬁcant reductions in recurrence and distant recurrence associated with anastrozole strongly suggest that a reduction in deaths from breast cancer will eventually be seen Since almost all patients have completed their scheduled 5 years of therapy the safety and tolerability data during treatment can be deemed ﬁnal Withdrawals due to adverse events were signiﬁcantly less common with anastrozole 344 11 1 than with tamoxifen 442 14 3 p 0 0002 Drug related serious adverse events were also signiﬁcantly less common with anastrozole 146 4 7 than with tamoxifen 271 9 0 p 0 0001 Treatment with anastrozole was associated with signiﬁcant reductions in the incidence of endometrial cancer thromboembolic events ischaemic cerebrovascular events vaginal bleeding hot ﬂushes and vaginal discharge compared with tamoxifen table Tamoxifen was associated with fewer fractures and less arthralgia than was anastrozole Fracture rates per 1000 woman years were 22 6 for anastrozole and 15 6 for tamoxifen hazard ratio 1 44 95 CI 1 21 1 68 p 0 0001 The incidence of hip fracture was low and similar for anastrozole and tamoxifen table Findings of several studies show that bisphosphonates are effective in maintaining bone density1 in women with breast cancer The risk ratios for all the prespeciﬁed adverse events in the present report were similar to those noted in previous analyses 2 3 suggesting that the safety proﬁle of anastrozole remains unchanged during the 5 year treatment period No new safety concerns emerged This analysis of the ATAC trial conﬁrms the efﬁcacy and tolerability beneﬁts of anastrozole as initial adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal women with localised breast cancer The results are only applicable to anastrozole since it is unknown how differences between the aromatase inhibitors affect their clinical usefulness Results from studies evaluating anastrozole or exemestane after 2 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen compared with continuing tamoxifen suggest that it is www thelancet com Published online December 8 2004 http image thelancet com extras 04let11120web

is not appropriate to wait 5 years to start an aromatase inhibitor Furthermore the higher rates of recurrence especially in years 1 3 and the increased numbers of adverse events and treatment withdrawals associated with tamoxifen lend support to the approach of offering the most effective and well tolerated therapy at the earliest opportunity 5 years of anastrozole should now be considered
