and Donald L Morton M D From the Joyce Eisenberg Keefer Breast Center John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John s Hospital and Health Center Santa Monica Califomia Objective The authors report the feasibility and accuracy of intraoperative lymphatic mapping with sentinel lymphadenectomy in patients with breast cancer Summary Background Data Axillary lymph node dissection ALND for breast cancer generally is accepted for its staging and prognostic value but the extent of dissection remains controversial Blind lymph node sampling or level dissection may miss some nodal metastases but ALND may result in lymphedema In melanoma intraoperative lymph node mapping with sentinel lymphadenectomy is an effective and minimally invasive alternative to ALND for identifying nodes containing metastases Methods One hundred seventy four mapping procedures were performed using a vital dye injected at the primary breast cancer site Axillary lymphatics were identified and followed to the first sentinel node which was selectively excised before ALND Results Sentinel nodes were identified in 1 14 of 174 65 5 procedures and accurately predicted axillary nodal status in 109 of 1 14 95 6 cases There was a definite learning curve and all falsenegative sentinel nodes occurred in the first part of the study sentinel nodes identified in the last 87 procedures were 100 predictive In 16 of 42 38 0 clinically negative pathologically positive axillae the sentinel node was the only tumor involved lymph node identified The anatomic location of the sentinel node was examined in the 54 most recent procedures ten cases had only level 11 nodal metastases that could have been missed by sampling or low level 1 axillary dissection Conclusions This experience indicates that intraoperative lymphatic mapping can accurately identify the sentinel node i e the axillary lymph node most likely to contain breast cancer metastases in some patients The technique could enhance staging accuracy and with further refinements and experience might alter the role of ALND The presence or absence of axillary lymph node metastases remains the most important prognostic factor in patients with potentially curable carcinoma of the breast and the development of effective adjuvant systemic therapies has made recognition of these metastases critical for patient management Historically nodal involvement was determined by radical axillary lymph node dissection usually as part of a radical mastectomy Recent data suggest that less radical axillary procedures may re sult in adequate axillary staging and regional control but 391 392 Giuliano and Others the extent of such limited operations is a point of controversy Underlying this controversy are questions concerning the accuracy of limited surgical staging and the role of axillary lymphadenectomy ALND Noninvasive staging of the axilla is inadequate Physical examination cannot accurately predict axillary lymph node metastasis Furthermore lymphangiography has not reliably demonstrated nodal disease 2 A recent study used positron emission tomography PET with intravenous 18 fluoro 2 deoxyglucose FDG to demonstrate primary breast carcinoma and regional metastases 3 however results are preliminary and the limits of detection and size of detectable lesions or metastases are unknown Definitive diagnosis of axillary metastasis in patients with breast cancer requires excision and histologic examination of axillary lymph nodes How many nodes should be removed to ensure accurate staging Although ALND remains the gold standard for sensitivity and accuracy of detection it carries a higher morbidity than sampling techniques Morton and others4 have demonstrated the accuracy of intraoperative lymphatic mapping and selective sentinel lymphadenectomy to identify lymph node metastasis in patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma reporting a false negative rate of less than 1 in more than 500 cases This high degree of accuracy has been substantiated at other institutions where patients with melanoma are treated 5 We developed and used a modification of lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy to detect axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast carcinoma PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with potentially curable breast carcinoma who were undergoing ALND as part of their standard treatment were evaluated Patients with prior axillary operations dissection excisional biopsy were excluded Each patient underwent intraoperative lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy during modified radical mastectomy or segmental mastectomy with ALND All operations were performed by the same surgeon who had no prior experience with lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy Informed consent

induction ofgeneral anesthesia isosulfan blue vital dye Lymphazurin Hirsch Industries Inc Richmond VA was injected with a 25 gauge needle into the breast mass and surrounding breast parenchyma The first 20 patients received 0 5 to 10 mL of dye in subsequent cases the dose was standardized at 3 to 5 mL If the primary tumor had been excised previously the dye was injected into the wall of the biopsy cavity and surrounding breast parenchyma through several points along the incision During the first 20 cases the interval between dye injection and axillary incision was varied from 1 to 20 minutes to determine the time required for dye to reach the axillary drainage basin A standard interval of approximately 5 minutes was used in the remaining cases A transverse incision was made just below the hair bearing region ofthe axilla Blunt dissection was performed until a lymphatic tract or blue stained node was identified The dye filled tract was dissected to the first blue lymph node If possible the tract was followed proximally to the tail of the breast to ensure that the identified lymph node was the most proximal lymph node and thus the sentinel node This lymph node was excised

procedures In the last 50 cases the rate of detection was 78 0 The accuracy of lymphatic mapping was examined by comparing the histopathology of sentinel node and nonsentinel node ALND specimens The

staining sentinel nodes in levels I and II DISCUSSION Determination of axillary nodal status is essential for the staging of breast cancer However the extent of axillary dissection required for accurate staging is controversial Total dissection of the axilla has the highest morbid ity 7 but offers the greatest staging accuracy The accuracy of limited dissections or sampling procedures is unclear partially because these procedures often are ill defined and partially because of the methods used to evaluate their accuracy Differences in staging techniques are best described by Kinne 8 Sampling is the removal of an axillary node or nodes from the lower axilla without defining precise anatomic boundaries Low axillary dissection is an en bloc excision of level I lymph nodes defined anatomically as lymph nodes medial to the latissimus dorsi muscle and extending to the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle and the axillary vein cephalad Level I and II dissection is an en bloc excision of the low and middle portions of the axilla dissection extends from the latissimus dorsi to the medial edge of the pectoralis minor and to the axillary vein Total axillary dissection levels I II and III removes the entire contents of the axilla from the latissimus dorsi laterally to the subclavius muscle Halsted s ligament medially 396 Giuliano and Others Ann Surg September 1994

staging accuracy should be considered when making decisions regarding the extent of axillary dissection in breast cancer Fisher et al have suggested that ALND offers no survival advantage and that level I and II dissection would accurately stage most patients with breast cancer in this study the majority of breast cancer patients with axillary disease had metastases limited to level I nodes Because the survival benefit of ALND is unclear the necessary extent of axillary dissection may be determined best by staging accuracy and local control Axillary staging operations range from sampling with blind biopsy alone 9 13 to complete or total dissection 14 20 Intraoperative assessment of axillary nodal status using immediate imprint cytology of blind or randomly selected enlarged lymph nodes has a reported accuracy of 85 however it has a false negative rate of 14 13 Blind sampling of axillary lymph nodes misses metastases in 15 to 42 of cases 3 8 In a study of patients undergoing radical mastectomy Davies et al 5 removed fibroadipose tissue from approximately the level of the third rib immediately before ALND Forty two per cent of these tissue specimens were tumor negative whereas higher level lymph nodes in the corresponding ALND specimen were tumor positive The reported incidence Table 5 ANALYSIS OF CLINICALLY NEGATIVE HISTOLOGICALLY POSITIVE AXILLAE CONTAINING

from 1 3 to 42 1 o1 114 16 18 21 23 This variation in incidence may be a result of different techniques of axillary dissection difficulties in reconstructing normal axillary anatomy in isolated surgical specimens and variations in lymphatic anatomy and drainage patterns Sarce et al 8 divided postoperative specimens into the following five separate levels low axillary midaxillary high axillary interpectoral and apical They found that 15 of the involved lymph nodes were identified only in the higher axillary levels Finally Kissen et al 7 showed that sampling failed to identify 8 of patients with lymph node metastases and failed to obtain a specimen with identifiable lymph nodes in another 10 of patients The accuracy of sampling is related to the number and location of lymph nodes examined Forrest et al 9 removed pectoral nodes near the tail ofthe breast probably level I nodes and reported metastasis detection rates similar to those in radical mastectomy specimens However 25 of the sampling procedures did not yield lymph nodes and 10 5 of the patients whose pectoral nodes were not identified or were identified as uninvolved with tumors developed regionally recurrent disease Forrest et al demonstrated an 8 false negative rate in specimens with three to four lymph nodes and Steele et al 12 suggested that removal of at least four nodes from the lower axillary fat pad near the tail of the breast was as accurate as ALND Kjaergaard et al 24 showed that axillary recurrence in breast cancer patients with low risk primary lesions decreases as the number of excised lymph nodes increases Their rate of axillary recurrence resulting from missed or untreated disease was 12 when no nodes were removed 7 when two lymph nodes were removed and only 2 when more than three lymph nodes were removed In a similar study Graversen et al 25 reported a 3 rate of axillary recurrence after removal of five to ten axillary lymph nodes Mathiesen et al 26 suggested ten as the minimum number of excised nodes for an adequate sampling procedure Axillary recurrence is associated with the number of metastatic nodes 27 especially when four or more nodes are involved or fewer than ten nodes have been sampled 28 Complete axillary dissection markedly decreases the incidence of axillary recurrence 29 30 Benson et al 3 Lymphatic Mapping for Breast Cancer Vol 220 No 3 demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in axillary recurrence rate among patients receiving complete nodal dissection described as levels I and II when compared to a sampling procedure similar to the pectoral node procedure This difference in regional recurrence was seen in patients with positive nodes and patients with negative nodes Complete axillary dissection results in recurrence rates approaching zero at 50 months and provides accurate staging 20 The accuracy of sampling only can be equivalent to complete node dissection if sampling procedures included enough lymph nodes to detect skip metastases to any level of the axilla The number of nodes also must be large enough to detect metastatic involvement by chance alone The importance of accurate axillary staging to select candidates for adjuvant therapy has led most authorities to recommend level I and II axillary dissection for patients with breast cancer despite the apparently low rate of skip metastases This is summarized in a 1992 consensus statement from the National Cancer Institute 32 We have demonstrated a technique that appears to identify specific lymph nodes draining specific primary breast cancer sites Excision of these sentinel nodes alone should have an extremely low morbidity and a high degree of staging accuracy In our study sentinel lymph nodes were significantly more likely to contain metastases than nonsentinel lymph nodes removed during ALND In the second half of this study 87 patients the sentinel node accurately predicted tumor involvement of the axilla in every patient Although most of the sentinel nodes were in anatomic level I of the axilla 23 3 of our most recent dissections yielded a sentinel node in level II alone Because the sentinel node was the only positive lymph node in 38 of tumor positive axillary basins a blind sampling procedure or a level I dissection could miss involved sentinel nodes in level II Although Veronesi et al 21 23 proposed an orderly progression of tumor cells from level I to level II and then to level III our data suggest that metastatic spread to the axilla is determined by the specific lymphatic drainage of the primary tumor which in turn depends on each patient s lymphatic anatomy The ability to identify a tumor free sentinel lymph node could enable the surgeon to accurately stage nodenegative breast cancer patients without subjecting them to the morbidity of a formal dissection Total ALND could be reserved for those patients proven to have regional axillary nodal metastases Because we believe that the accuracy of sentinel lymphadenectomy in breast cancer should be equivalent to its accuracy in malignant melanoma we are investigating methods to increase the rate of identifying the sentinel node and detecting nodal metastases The findings for lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy if confirmed could have sig 397 nificant implications Axillary mapping with sentinel lymphadenectomy enhances the accuracy of surgical staging and also may improve histologic staging by enabling the pathologist to focus on fewer lymph nodes Further metastases in the axilla may occur in an orderly fashion by appearing first in the sentinel lymph node Nodal metastases that appear to skip an axillary level may result from variations in regional lymphatic drainage rather than nonsequential progression oftumor cells Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymphadenectomy should diminish staging morbidity and could alter the surgical management of the axilla in women with breast cancer Addendum Since this manuscript was submitted the authors have experienced one false negative sentinel node Thus the false negative rate since the first 87 cases is 1 of 137 0 73 equivalent to the false negative rate in melanoma References 1 Fisher B Wolmark N Bauer M et al The accuracy of clinical nodal staging and of limited axillary dissection as a determinant of histologic nodal status in carcinoma of the breast

Eur J Surg Oncol 1986 12 267 271 NIH Consensus Development Conference NIH Consensus Statement 1992 8 1 19 Discussion DR KIRBY I BLAND Providence Rhode Island First let me begin by congratulating the authors Dr Giuliano Dr Mor Ann Surg September 1994 ton and associates for bringing this important new technique to the attention ofthe Association As the authors have properly emphasized axillary lymph node dissection is essential to address the proper therapy both in the adjuvant as well as the therapeutic setting for invasive breast carcinoma The difficulty however with blind sampling of Level 1 and 2 axillary nodes is the fact that the surgeon would frequently miss pathologically positive nodal metastases Most clinics in North America and Europe currently recommend the sampling of a minimal ten nodes to accurately predict the extent of regional disease Numerous studies have correlated the number of nodes to disease free survival and overall survival therapy schedules are often designed for the number of pathologically positive nodes As an example as you know young women with ten or more nodes today very commonly are relegated to autologous bone marrow transplantation The authors should be acknowledged for their important contribution to intraoperative lymph node mapping with sentinel lymphadenectomy for intermediate thickness melanoma And now we see if for breast carcinoma staging Although I was originally skeptical about the application of these techniques for melanoma with increasing usage I have now become comfortable with the technique for preoperative lymphoscintigraphy to assist identification of sentinel nodes and the vital blue dye Azozurin TM to actually provide you with visual identification of the first echelon of these potential metastases This technique is efficacious cost effective and provides a very high predictive value as Dr Giuliano just showed us for metastasis The authors now have confirmed similar value for breast staging The breast however often has variable and multidirectional distribution of lymphatic flow this is especially true of medial quadrant and central lesions This study concluded that overall two thirds of the sentinel nodes were identified however in the latter phases you have shown us that all the lymphatics could be identified in sentinel sites Importantly the accurate pathological node status was determined in 96 of these cases Armando my first question to you would be how might we increase the yield to identify all sentinel nodes Is this simply a function of familiarity with the technique Are there other issues that you perhaps should ad dress Secondly lymphoscintigraphy using subdermal injections with technetium sulfur colloid or albumin is an extremely advantageous technique for mapping of cutaneous melanoma lymphatic distribution Will your future approaches perhaps for mapping be inclusive of this technique either prior to or synchronous with the injection of isosulfan blue Your study has suggested statistically significant value to predict positive nodal disease when only one sentinel node is identified You identified tumor positive nodes in 72 of these patients in the sentinel node sites That s compared with only 1 or less if the nodes were nonsentinel in location You found essentially the same thing however in the clinically negative node positive axilla Your numbers were 62 but on the other hand you ve had an increase of over 30 fold to 14 for finding node positive disease in nonsentinel sites So I d ask you again would lymphoscintigraphy perhaps have enhanced the probability of selective biopsy of these vital dye stained nodes This is an important consideration because
